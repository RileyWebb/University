**Question 1:**
The energy expended in moving a charge of 30 coulomb through a potential difference of 0.6 volts is: $30 \cdot 0.6 = 18$.

**Question 2:**
If 0.18 coulomb of charge passes by a point every 7.5 ms then the current in amperes is equal to: $\dfrac{0.18}{7.5\cdot 10^{-3}} = 24$.

**Question 3:**
Cutting the area of a conductor in half will double the resistance due to $R = \dfrac{ρ \cdot L} {A}$ where;
$R$ is the resistance,
$ρ$ is the resistivity of the material,
$L$ is the length,
$A$ is the area.

**Question 4:**
A 560 Ω with ± 5% tolerance resistor has the following colour code: green, blue, brown, gold

**Question 5:**
A 20 kΩ resistor has a conductance of:  *ANSWER DUMBASS*

**Question 6:**
Four 220 Ω, ±5% resistors are measured with an ohmmeter. One of the measured resistor values is not within the ±5% tolerance. Which one of the following readings is out of bounds?
Upper bound: $220 \cdot 0.95 = 209$
Lower bound: $220 \cdot 1.05 = 231$
$207$ is out of tolerance.

**Question 7:**
A resistor has colour bands brown, black, silver and gold. The value of this resistor equals to: $10 \cdot 10^{-2} = 0.1\ohm$ with a tolerance of $\pm 5 \%$.

**Question 8:**
A clock has an internal resistance of 8.2k Ω. The current through the clock if it is powered by a 220V outlet equals to: $\dfrac{220}{8200}=26.83$ mAmp.

**Question 9:**
A system with an input power of 70 watts and an output power of 25 watts has an efficiency in percent of $\dfrac{25}{70}\approx 0.357$.

**Question 10:**
How many joules of energy will a 15 watts lamp dissipates in one hr?

**Question 11:**
If a voltage in a circuit changes from 4 V to 8 V and the current in the same circuit changes from 3 mA to 5 mA, the resistance of the circuit is $I=\dfrac{4}{3\cdot 10^{-3}}=\dfrac{8}{5\cdot 10^{-3}}$ *REDO BITCH*
