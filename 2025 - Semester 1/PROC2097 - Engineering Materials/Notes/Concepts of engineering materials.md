# Types of material properties

- **Mechanical**
	- Stresses (elastic deformation)
		- Shear (stress parallel to a surface)
		- Normal (perpendicular to a cross-section)
		- Longitudinal (stress that changes the length of a material)
		- Tensile (stress that increases the length of a body)
		- Compressive (stress that decreases the length of a body)
	- Strains (plastic deformation)
- **Thermal**
- **Electrical**
- **Optical**
- **Chemical**
- **Magnetic**
- **Acoustic**
