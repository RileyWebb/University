A sculpture weighing 10,000 N rests on a horizontal surface at the top of a 6 m tall vertical pillar. The pillar’s cross sectional area is 0.20 m2 and it is made of granite with a density of 2700 kg/m3. Find the compressive stress at the cross-section loated 3.0m below the top of the pillar and the value of the compressive strain of the top 3.0 m segment of the pillar. Youngs Modulus for Granite is Y=4.5 × 10 10 pa.
