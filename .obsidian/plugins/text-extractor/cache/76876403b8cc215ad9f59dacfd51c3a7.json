Even the arts, initially so deter- mined not to utilize technological methods, are embracing some of the new, innovative techniques that permit exploration into areas they never thought possible. The new Windows approach to computer simulation has made computer systems much friendlier to the average person, resulting in an expanding market which further stimulates growth in the ﬁeld. The computer in the home will eventually be as common as the telephone or television. In fact, all three are now being integrated into a single unit. Every facet of our lives seems touched by developments that appear to surface at an ever-increasing rate. For the layperson, the most obvious improvement of recent years has been the reduced size of electrical/ elec- tronics systems. Televisions are now small enough to be hand-held and have a battery capability that allows them to be more portable. Computers with signiﬁcant memory capacity are now smaller than this textbook. The size of radios is limited simply by our ability to read the numbers on the face of the dial. Hearing aids are no longer visible, and pacemakers are signiﬁcantly smaller and more reliable. All the reduction in size is due primarily to a marvelous development of the last few decades—the integrated circuit (IC). First developed in the late 1950s, the IC has now reached a point where cutting 0.18-micrometer lines is commonplace. The integrated circuit shown in Fig. 1.1 is the Intel ® Pentium ® 4 processor, which has 42 million transistors in an area measuring only 0.34 square inches. Intel Corporation recently presented a technical paper describing 0.02-micrometer (20-nanometer) transistors, developed in its silicon research laboratory. These small, ultra-fast transistors will permit placing nearly one billion transistors on a sliver of silicon no larger than a ﬁnger- nail. Microprocessors built from these transistors will operate at about 20 GHz. It leaves us only to wonder about the limits of such development. It is natural to wonder what the limits to growth may be when we consider the changes over the last few decades. Rather than following a steady growth curve that would be somewhat predictable, the industry is subject to surges that revolve around signiﬁcant developments in the ﬁeld. Present indications are that the level of miniaturization will con- tinue, but at a more moderate pace. Interest has turned toward increas- ing the quality and yield levels (percentage of good integrated circuits in the production process). \u0001 S I Introduction \u0001 S I 2  INTRODUCTION History reveals that there have been peaks and valleys in industry growth but that revenues continue to rise at a steady rate and funds set aside for research and development continue to command an increasing share of the budget. The ﬁeld changes at a rate that requires constant retraining of employees from the entry to the director level. Many com- panies have instituted their own training programs and have encouraged local universities to develop programs to ensure that the latest concepts and procedures are brought to the attention of their employees. A period of relaxation could be disastrous to a company dealing in competitive products. No matter what the pressures on an individual in this ﬁeld may be to keep up with the latest technology, there is one saving grace that becomes immediately obvious: Once a concept or procedure is clearly and correctly understood, it will bear fruit throughout the career of the individual at any level of the industry. For example, once a fundamen- tal equation such as Ohm’s law (Chapter 4) is understood, it will not be replaced by another equation as more advanced theory is considered. It is a relationship of fundamental quantities that can have application in the most advanced setting. In addition, once a procedure or method of analysis is understood, it usually can be applied to a wide (if not inﬁ- nite) variety of problems, making it unnecessary to learn a different technique for each slight variation in the system. The content of this text is such that every morsel of information will have application in more advanced courses. It will not be replaced by a different set of equations and procedures unless required by the speciﬁc area of appli- cation. Even then, the new procedures will usually be an expanded application of concepts already presented in the text. It is paramount therefore that the material presented in this introduc- tory course be clearly and precisely understood. It is the foundation for the material to follow and will be applied throughout your working days in this growing and exciting ﬁeld. 1.2A BRIEF HISTORY In the sciences, once a hypothesis is proven and accepted, it becomes one of the building blocks of that area of study, permitting additional investigation and development. Naturally, the more pieces of a puzzle available, the more obvious the avenue toward a possible solution. In fact, history demonstrates that a single development may provide the key that will result in a mushroom effect that brings the science to a new plateau of understanding and impact. If the opportunity presents itself, read one of the many publications reviewing the history of this ﬁeld. Space requirements are such that only a brief review can be provided here. There are many more con- tributors than could be listed, and their efforts have often provided important keys to the solution of some very important concepts. As noted earlier, there were periods characterized by what appeared to be an explosion of interest and development in particular areas. As you will see from the discussion of the late 1700s and the early 1800s, inventions, discoveries, and theories came fast and furiously. Each new concept has broadened the possible areas of application until it becomes almost impossible to trace developments without picking a particular area of interest and following it through. In the review, as you read about the development of the radio, television, and computer, keep in FIG. 1.1 Computer chip on ﬁnger.

There is a tendency when reading about the great scientists, inventors, and innovators to believe that their contribution was a totally individual effort. In many instances, this was not the case. In fact, many of the great contributors were friends or associates who provided support and encouragement in their efforts to investigate various theories. At the very least, they were aware of one another’s efforts to the degree possible in the days when a letter was often the best form of communication. In par- ticular, note the closeness of the dates during periods of rapid develop- ment. One contributor seemed to spur on the efforts of the others or pos- sibly provided the key needed to continue with the area of interest. In the early stages, the contributors were not electrical, electronic, or computer engineers as we know them today. In most cases, they were physicists, chemists, mathematicians, or even philosophers. In addition, they were not from one or two communities of the Old World. The home country of many of the major contributors introduced in the paragraphs to follow is provided to show that almost every established community had some impact on the development of the fundamental laws of electri- cal circuits. As you proceed through the remaining chapters of the text, you will ﬁnd that a number of the units of measurement bear the name of major contributors in those areas—volt after Count Alessandro Volta, ampere after André Ampère, ohm after Georg Ohm, and so forth—ﬁtting recog- nition for their important contributions to the birth of a major ﬁeld of study. Time charts indicating a limited number of major developments are provided in Fig. 1.2, primarily to identify speciﬁc periods of rapid development and to reveal how far we have come in the last few decades.

As you read through the following brief review, try to sense the growing interest in the ﬁeld and the enthusiasm and excitement that must have accompanied each new revelation. Although you may ﬁnd some of the terms used in the review new and essentially meaningless, the remaining chapters will explain them thoroughly. The Beginning The phenomenon of static electricity has been toyed with since antiq- uity. The Greeks called the fossil resin substance so often used to demonstrate the effects of static electricity elektron, but no extensive study was made of the subject until William Gilbert researched the event in 1600. In the years to follow, there was a continuing investiga- tion of electrostatic charge by many individuals such as Otto von Guer- icke, who developed the ﬁrst machine to generate large amounts of charge, and Stephen Gray, who was able to transmit electrical charge over long distances on silk threads. Charles DuFay demonstrated that charges either attract or repel each other, leading him to believe that there were two types of charge—a theory we subscribe to today with our deﬁned positive and negative charges. There are many who believe that the true beginnings of the electrical era lie with the efforts of Pieter van Musschenbroek and Benjamin Franklin. In 1745, van Musschenbroek introduced the Leyden jar for the storage of electrical charge (the ﬁrst capacitor) and demonstrated electrical shock (and therefore the power of this new form of energy). Franklin used the Leyden jar some seven years later to establish that lightning is simply an electrical discharge, and he expanded on a num- ber of other important theories including the deﬁnition of the two types of charge as positive and negative. From this point on, new discoveries and theories seemed to occur at an increasing rate as the number of individuals performing research in the area grew. In 1784, Charles Coulomb demonstrated in Paris that the force between charges is inversely related to the square of the distance between the charges. In 1791, Luigi Galvani, professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna, Italy, performed experiments on the effects of electricity on animal nerves and muscles. The ﬁrst voltaic cell, with its ability to produce electricity through the chemical action of a metal dissolving in an acid, was developed by another Italian, Alessandro Volta, in 1799. The fever pitch continued into the early 1800s with Hans Christian Oersted, a Swedish professor of physics, announcing in 1820 a relation- ship between magnetism and electricity that serves as the foundation for the theory of electromagnetism as we know it today. In the same year, a French physicist, André Ampère, demonstrated that there are magnetic effects around every current-carrying conductor and that current-carry- ing conductors can attract and repel each other just like magnets. In the period 1826 to 1827, a German physicist, Georg Ohm, introduced an important relationship between potential, current, and resistance which we now refer to as Ohm’s law. In 1831, an English physicist, Michael Faraday, demonstrated his theory of electromagnetic induction, whereby a changing current in one coil can induce a changing current in another coil, even though the two coils are not directly connected. Professor Faraday also did extensive work on a storage device he called the con- 4  INTRODUCTION\u0001 S I A BRIEF HISTORY  5 denser, which we refer to today as a capacitor. He introduced the idea of adding a dielectric between the plates of a capacitor to increase the stor- age capacity (Chapter 10). James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish professor of natural philosophy, performed extensive mathematical analyses to develop what are currently called Maxwell’s equations, which support the efforts of Faraday linking electric and magnetic effects. Maxwell also developed the electromagnetic theory of light in 1862, which, among other things, revealed that electromagnetic waves travel through air at the velocity of light (186,000 miles per second or 3 \u0002 108 meters per second). In 1888, a German physicist, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz, through experimentation with lower-frequency electromagnetic waves (microwaves), substantiated Maxwell’s predictions and equations. In the mid 1800s, Professor Gustav Robert Kirchhoff introduced a series of laws of voltages and currents that ﬁnd application at every level and area of this ﬁeld (Chapters 5 and 6). In 1895, another German physicist, Wil- helm Röntgen, discovered electromagnetic waves of high frequency, commonly called Xrays today. By the end of the 1800s, a signiﬁcant number of the fundamental equations, laws, and relationships had been established, and various ﬁelds of study, including electronics, power generation, and calculating equipment, started to develop in earnest. The Age of Electronics Radio The true beginning of the electronics era is open to debate and is sometimes attributed to efforts by early scientists in applying poten- tials across evacuated glass envelopes. However, many trace the begin- ning to Thomas Edison, who added a metallic electrode to the vacuum of the tube and discovered that a current was established between the metal electrode and the ﬁlament when a positive voltage was applied to the metal electrode. The phenomenon, demonstrated in 1883, was referred to as the Edison effect. In the period to follow, the transmis- sion of radio waves and the development of the radio received wide- spread attention. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz, in his efforts to verify Maxwell’s equations, transmitted radio waves for the ﬁrst time in his laboratory. In 1896, an Italian scientist, Guglielmo Marconi (often called the father of the radio), demonstrated that telegraph signals could be sent through the air over long distances (2.5 kilometers) using a grounded antenna. In the same year, Aleksandr Popov sent what might have been the ﬁrst radio message some 300 yards. The message was the name “Heinrich Hertz” in respect for Hertz’s earlier contributions. In 1901, Marconi established radio communication across the Atlantic. In 1904, John Ambrose Fleming expanded on the efforts of Edison to develop the ﬁrst diode, commonly called Fleming’s valve—actually the ﬁrst of the electronic devices. The device had a profound impact on the design of detectors in the receiving section of radios. In 1906, Lee De Forest added a third element to the vacuum structure and created the ﬁrst ampliﬁer, the triode. Shortly thereafter, in 1912, Edwin Armstrong built the ﬁrst regenerative circuit to improve receiver capabilities and then used the same contribution to develop the ﬁrst nonmechanical oscillator. By 1915 radio signals were being transmitted across the United States, and in 1918 Armstrong applied for a patent for the super- heterodyne circuit employed in virtually every television and radio to permit ampliﬁcation at one frequency rather than at the full range of \u0001 S I 6  INTRODUCTION incoming signals. The major components of the modern-day radio were now in place, and sales in radios grew from a few million dollars in the early 1920s to over $1 billion by the 1930s. The 1930s were truly the golden years of radio, with a wide range of productions for the listen- ing audience. Television The 1930s were also the true beginnings of the television era, although development on the picture tube began in earlier years with Paul Nipkow and his electrical telescope in 1884 and John Baird and his long list of successes, including the transmission of television pictures over telephone lines in 1927 and over radio waves in 1928, and simultaneous transmission of pictures and sound in 1930. In 1932, NBC installed the ﬁrst commercial television antenna on top of the Empire State Building in New York City, and RCA began regular broadcasting in 1939. The war slowed development and sales, but in the mid 1940s the number of sets grew from a few thousand to a few million. Color television became popular in the early 1960s. Computers The earliest computer system can be traced back to Blaise Pascal in 1642 with his mechanical machine for adding and sub- tracting numbers. In 1673 Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz used the Leibniz wheel to add multiplication and division to the range of opera- tions, and in 1823 Charles Babbage developed the difference engine to add the mathematical operations of sine, cosine, logs, and several oth- ers. In the years to follow, improvements were made, but the system remained primarily mechanical until the 1930s when electromechanical systems using components such as relays were introduced. It was not until the 1940s that totally electronic systems became the new wave. It is interesting to note that, even though IBM was formed in 1924, it did not enter the computer industry until 1937. An entirely electronic sys- tem known as ENIAC was dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. It contained 18,000 tubes and weighed 30 tons but was several times faster than most electromechanical systems. Although other vac- uum tube systems were built, it was not until the birth of the solid-state era that computer systems experienced a major change in size, speed, and capability. The Solid-State Era In 1947, physicists William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter H. Brattain of Bell Telephone Laboratories demonstrated the point-contact transistor (Fig. 1.3), an ampliﬁer constructed entirely of solid-state materials with no requirement for a vacuum, glass envelope, or heater voltage for the ﬁlament. Although reluctant at ﬁrst due to the vast amount of material available on the design, analysis, and synthesis of tube networks, the industry eventually accepted this new technology as the wave of the future. In 1958 the ﬁrst integrated circuit (IC) was developed at Texas Instruments, and in 1961 the ﬁrst commercial inte- grated circuit was manufactured by the Fairchild Corporation. It is impossible to review properly the entire history of the electri- cal/electronics ﬁeld in a few pages. The effort here, both through the discussion and the time graphs of Fig. 1.2, was to reveal the amazing progress of this ﬁeld in the last 50 years. The growth appears to be truly exponential since the early 1900s, raising the interesting question, Where do we go from here? The time chart suggests that the next few FIG. 1.3 The ﬁrst transistor. (Courtesy of AT&T, Bell Laboratories.) \u0001 S I UNITS OF MEASUREMENT  7 decades will probably contain many important innovative contributions that may cause an even faster growth curve than we are now experienc- ing. 1.3 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT In any technical ﬁeld it is naturally important to understand the basic concepts and the impact they will have on certain parameters. However, the application of these rules and laws will be successful only if the mathematical operations involved are applied correctly. In particular, it is vital that the importance of applying the proper unit of measurement to a quantity is understood and appreciated. Students often generate a numerical solution but decide not to apply a unit of measurement to the result because they are somewhat unsure of which unit should be applied. Consider, for example, the following very fundamental physics equation: v \u0003 velocity d \u0003 distance (1.1) t \u0003 time Assume, for the moment, that the following data are obtained for a moving object: d \u0003 4000 ft t \u0003 1 min and v is desired in miles per hour. Often, without a second thought or consideration, the numerical values are simply substituted into the equation, with the result here that As indicated above, the solution is totally incorrect. If the result is desired in miles per hour, the unit of measurement for distance must be miles, and that for time, hours. In a moment, when the problem is ana- lyzed properly, the extent of the error will demonstrate the importance of ensuring that the numerical value substituted into an equation must have the unit of measurement speciﬁed by the equation. The next question is normally, How do I convert the distance and time to the proper unit of measurement? A method will be presented in a later section of this chapter, but for now it is given that 1 mi \u0003 5280 ft 4000 ft \u0003 0.7576 mi 1 min \u0003 h \u0003 0.0167 h Substituting into Eq. (1.1), we have v \u0003\u0003 \u0003 45.37 mi/h which is signiﬁcantly different from the result obtained before. To complicate the matter further, suppose the distance is given in kilometers, as is now the case on many road signs. First, we must real- ize that the preﬁx kilo stands for a multiplier of 1000 (to be introduced 0.7576 mi\u0004\u0004 0.0167 h d \u0004 t 1 \u0004 60 v \u0001 4000 mi/h d t 4000 ft 1 min \u0001 \u0001 v \u0003 \u0004 d t \u0004 \u0001 S I 8  INTRODUCTION in Section 1.5), and then we must ﬁnd the conversion factor between kilometers and miles. If this conversion factor is not readily available, we must be able to make the conversion between units using the con- version factors between meters and feet or inches, as described in Sec- tion 1.6. Before substituting numerical values into an equation, try to men- tally establish a reasonable range of solutions for comparison purposes. For instance, if a car travels 4000 ft in 1 min, does it seem reasonable that the speed would be 4000 mi/h? Obviously not! This self-checking procedure is particularly important in this day of the hand-held calcula- tor, when ridiculous results may be accepted simply because they appear on the digital display of the instrument. Finally, if a unit of measurement is applicable to a result or piece of data, then it must be applied to the numerical value. To state that v \u0003 45.37 without including the unit of measurement mi/h is meaningless. Equation (1.1) is not a difﬁcult one. A simple algebraic manipulation will result in the solution for any one of the three variables. However, in light of the number of questions arising from this equation, the reader may wonder if the difﬁculty associated with an equation will increase at the same rate as the number of terms in the equation. In the broad sense, this will not be the case. There is, of course, more room for a mathematical error with a more complex equation, but once the proper system of units is chosen and each term properly found in that system, there should be very little added difﬁculty associated with an equation requiring an increased number of mathematical calculations. In review, before substituting numerical values into an equation, be absolutely sure of the following: 1. Each quantity has the proper unit of measurement as deﬁned by the equation. 2. The proper magnitude of each quantity as determined by the deﬁning equation is substituted. 3. Each quantity is in the same system of units (or as deﬁned by the equation). 4. The magnitude of the result is of a reasonable nature when compared to the level of the substituted quantities. 5. The proper unit of measurement is applied to the result. 1.4 SYSTEMS OF UNITS In the past, the systems of units most commonly used were the English and metric, as outlined in Table 1.1. Note that while the English system is based on a single standard, the metric is subdivided into two interre- lated standards: the MKS and the CGS. Fundamental quantities of these systems are compared in Table 1.1 along with their abbreviations. The MKS and CGS systems draw their names from the units of mea- surement used with each system; the MKS system uses Meters, Kilo- grams, and Seconds, while the CGS system uses Centimeters, Grams, and Seconds. Understandably, the use of more than one system of units in a world that ﬁnds itself continually shrinking in size, due to advanced technical developments in communications and transportation, would introduce \u0001 S I SYSTEMS OF UNITS  9 unnecessary complications to the basic understanding of any technical data. The need for a standard set of units to be adopted by all nations has become increasingly obvious. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures located at Sèvres, France, has been the host for the Gen- eral Conference of Weights and Measures, attended by representatives from all nations of the world. In 1960, the General Conference adopted a system called Le Système International d’Unités (International Sys- tem of Units), which has the international abbreviation SI. Since then, it has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engi- neers, Inc. (IEEE) in 1965 and by the United States of America Stan- dards Institute in 1967 as a standard for all scientiﬁc and engineering literature. For comparison, the SI units of measurement and their abbreviations appear in Table 1.1. These abbreviations are those usually applied to each unit of measurement, and they were carefully chosen to be the most effective. Therefore, it is important that they be used whenever applicable to ensure universal understanding. Note the similarities of the SI system to the MKS system. This text will employ, whenever pos- sible and practical, all of the major units and abbreviations of the SI system in an effort to support the need for a universal system. Those readers requiring additional information on the SI system should con- tact the information ofﬁce of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).* *American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), 1818 N Street N.W., Suite 600, Washington, D.C. 20036-2479; (202) 331-3500; http://www.asee.org/. \u0001\u0003 °C \u0005 32\u0002 9 \u0004 5 TABLE 1.1 Comparison of the English and metric systems of units.

Note in the ﬁgure the relatively small magnitude of the units of mea- surement for the CGS system. A standard exists for each unit of measurement of each system. The standards of some units are quite interesting. The meter was originally deﬁned in 1790 to be 1/10,000,000 the distance between the equator and either pole at sea level, a length pre- served on a platinum-iridium bar at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sèvres, France. The meter is now deﬁned with reference to the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 299,792,458 m/s. The kilogram is deﬁned as a mass equal to 1000 times the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water at 4°C. This standard is preserved in the form of a platinum-iridium cylinder in Sèvres.

However, since Earth’s rotation is slowing down by almost 1 sec- ond every 10 years, the second was redeﬁned in 1967 as 9,192,631,770 periods of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a particular transition of cesium atom. 1.5 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES, ACCURACY, AND ROUNDING OFF This section will emphasize the importance of being aware of the source of a piece of data, how a number appears, and how it should be treated. Too often we write numbers in various forms with little concern for the format used, the number of digits that should be included, and the unit of measurement to be applied. For instance, measurements of 22.1\u0001 and 22.10\u0001 imply different lev- els of accuracy. The ﬁrst suggests that the measurement was made by an instrument accurate only to the tenths place; the latter was obtained with instrumentation capable of reading to the hundredths place. The use of zeros in a number, therefore, must be treated with care and the implications must be understood. In general, there are two types of numbers, exact and approximate. Exact numbers are precise to the exact number of digits presented, just as we know that there are 12 apples in a dozen and not 12.1. Throughout the text the numbers that appear in the descriptions, diagrams, and examples are considered exact, so that a battery of 100 V can be written as 100.0 V, 100.00 V, and so on, since it is 100 V at any level of precision. The addi- tional zeros were not included for purposes of clarity. However, in the laboratory environment, where measurements are continually being taken and the level of accuracy can vary from one instrument to another, it is important to understand how to work with the results. Any reading obtained in the laboratory should be considered approximate. The analog scales with their pointers may be difﬁcult to read, and even though the digital meter provides only speciﬁc digits on its display, it is limited to the number of digits it can provide, leaving us to wonder about the less signiﬁcant digits not appearing on the display. The precision of a reading can be determined by the number of sig- niﬁcant ﬁgures (digits) present. Signiﬁcant digits are those integers (0 to 9) that can be assumed to be accurate for the measurement being made. The result is that all nonzero numbers are considered signiﬁcant, with zeros being signiﬁcant in only some cases. For instance, the zeros in 1005 are considered signiﬁcant because they deﬁne the size of the number and are surrounded by nonzero digits. However, for a number such as 0.064, the two zeros are not considered signiﬁcant because they are used only to deﬁne the location of the decimal point and not the accuracy of the reading. For the number 0.4020, the zero to the left of the decimal point is not signiﬁcant, but the other two are because they deﬁne the magnitude of the number and the fourth-place accuracy of the reading. When adding approximate numbers, it is important to be sure that the accuracy of the readings is consistent throughout. To add a quantity accurate only to the tenths place to a number accurate to the thousandths \u0001 S I 12  INTRODUCTION place will result in a total having accuracy only to the tenths place. One cannot expect the reading with the higher level of accuracy to improve the reading with only tenths-place accuracy. In the addition or subtraction of approximate numbers, the entry with the lowest level of accuracy determines the format of the solution. For the multiplication and division of approximate numbers, the result has the same number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures as the number with the least number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For approximate numbers (and exact, for that matter) there is often a need to round off the result; that is, you must decide on the appropriate level of accuracy and alter the result accordingly. The accepted proce- dure is simply to note the digit following the last to appear in the rounded-off form, and add a 1 to the last digit if it is greater than or equal to 5, and leave it alone if it is less than 5. For example, 3.186 \u0003 3.19 \u0003 3.2, depending on the level of precision desired. The symbol \u0003 appearing means approximately equal to. EXAMPLE 1.1 Perform the indicated operations with the following approximate numbers and round off to the appropriate level of accu- racy. a. 532.6 \u0005 4.02 \u0005 0.036 \u0003 536.656 \u0003 536.7 (as determined by 532.6) b. 0.04 \u0005 0.003 \u0005 0.0064 \u0003 0.0494 \u0003 0.05 (as determined by 0.04) c. 4.632 \u0002 2.4 \u0003 11.1168 \u0003 11 (as determined by the two signiﬁcant digits of 2.4) d. 3.051 \u0002 802 \u0003 2446.902 \u0003 2450 (as determined by the three sig- niﬁcant digits of 802) e. 1402/6.4 \u0003 219.0625 \u0003 220 (as determined by the two signiﬁcant digits of 6.4) f. 0.0046/0.05 \u0003 0.0920 \u0003 0.09 (as determined by the one signiﬁcant digit of 0.05) 1.6 POWERS OF TEN It should be apparent from the relative magnitude of the various units of measurement that very large and very small numbers will frequently be encountered in the sciences. To ease the difﬁculty of mathematical operations with numbers of such varying size, powers of ten are usually employed. This notation takes full advantage of the mathematical prop- erties of powers of ten. The notation used to represent numbers that are integer powers of ten is as follows: 1 \u0003 10 0 1/10 \u0003 0.1 \u0003 10 \u00061 10 \u0003 10 1 1/100 \u0003 0.01 \u0003 10 \u00062 100 \u0003 10 2 1/1000 \u0003 0.001 \u0003 10 \u00063 1000 \u0003 10 3 1/10,000 \u0003 0.0001 \u0003 10 \u00064 In particular, note that 100 \u0003 1, and, in fact, any quantity to the zero power is 1 (x 0 \u0003 1, 1000 0 \u0003 1, and so on). Also, note that the numbers in the list that are greater than 1 are associated with positive powers of ten, and numbers in the list that are less than 1 are associated with neg- ative powers of ten. \u0001 S I POWERS OF TEN  13 A quick method of determining the proper power of ten is to place a caret mark to the right of the numeral 1 wherever it may occur; then count from this point to the number of places to the right or left before arriving at the decimal point. Moving to the right indicates a positive power of ten, whereas moving to the left indicates a negative power. For example, Some important mathematical equations and relationships pertaining to powers of ten are listed below, along with a few examples. In each case, n and m can be any positive or negative real number. (1.2) Equation (1.2) clearly reveals that shifting a power of ten from the denominator to the numerator, or the reverse, requires simply changing the sign of the power.

The number 5000 can be written as 5 \u0002 1000 \u0003 5 \u0002 10 3, and the number 0.0004 can be written as 4 \u0002 0.0001 \u0003 4 \u0002 10\u00064.Of course, 10 5 can also be written as 1 \u0002 105 if it clariﬁes the operation to be performed. Addition and Subtraction To perform addition or subtraction using powers of ten, the power of ten must be the same for each term; that is, (1.6) Equation (1.6) covers all possibilities, but students often prefer to remember a verbal description of how to perform the operation. Equation (1.6) states when adding or subtracting numbers in a powers-of-ten format, be sure that the power of ten is the same for each number. Then separate the multipliers, perform the required operation, and apply the same power of ten to the result. EXAMPLE 1.6 a. 6300 \u0005 75,000 \u0003 (6.3)(1000) \u0005 (75)(1000) \u0003 6.3 \u0002 10 3 \u0005 75 \u0002 10 3 \u0003 (6.3 \u0005 75) \u0002 10 3 \u0003 81.3 \u0001 10 3 b. 0.00096 \u0006 0.000086 \u0003 (96)(0.00001) \u0006 (8.6)(0.00001) \u0003 96 \u0002 10 \u00065 \u0006 8.6 \u0002 10 \u00065 \u0003 (96 \u0006 8.6) \u0002 10 \u00065 \u0003 87.4 \u0001 10 \u00025 Multiplication In general, (1.7)(A \u0002 10 n)(B \u0002 10m) \u0003 (A)(B) \u0002 10 n\u0005m A \u0002 10n \u0007 B \u0002 10 n \u0003 (A \u0007 B) \u0002 10 n (10 n) m \u0003 10 (nm) \u0001 S I POWERS OF TEN  15 revealing that the operations with the powers of ten can be separated from the operation with the multipliers. Equation (1.7) states when multiplying numbers in the powers-of-ten format, ﬁrst ﬁnd the product of the multipliers and then determine the power of ten for the result by adding the power-of-ten exponents. EXAMPLE 1.7 a. (0.0002)(0.000007) \u0003 [(2)(0.0001)][(7)(0.000001)] \u0003 (2 \u0002 10 \u00064)(7 \u0002 10 \u00066) \u0003 (2)(7) \u0002 (10 \u00064)(10 \u00066) \u0003 14 \u0001 10 \u000210 b.

Equation (1.8) states when dividing numbers in the powers-of-ten format, ﬁrst ﬁnd the result of dividing the multipliers. Then determine the associated power for the result by subtracting the power of ten of the denominator from the power of ten of the numerator.

Determine the power-of-ten component by multiplying the power of ten by the power to be determined.

One is the product of two numbers in the powers-of-ten format, while the other is a number in the powers-of-ten format taken to a power. As noted below, the results of each are quite different: (10 3)(10 3) \b (10 3) 3 (10 3)(10 3) \u0003 10 6 \u0003 1,000,000 (10 3) 3 \u0003 (10 3)(10 3)(10 3) \u0003 10 9 \u0003 1,000,000,000 Fixed-Point, Floating-Point, Scientiﬁc, and Engineering Notation There are, in general, four ways in which numbers appear when using a computer or calculator. If powers of ten are not employed, they are written in the ﬁxed-point or ﬂoating-point notation. The ﬁxed-point format requires that the decimal point appear in the same place each time. In the ﬂoating-point format, the decimal point will appear in a location deﬁned by the number to be displayed. Most computers and calculators permit a choice of ﬁxed- or ﬂoating-point notation. In the ﬁxed format, the user can choose the level of precision for the output as tenths place, hundredths place, thousandths place, and so on. Every out- put will then ﬁx the decimal point to one location, such as the follow- ing examples using thousandths place accuracy: \u0003 0.333 \u0003 0.063 \u0003 1150.000 If left in the ﬂoating-point format, the results will appear as follows for the above operations: \u0003 0.333333333333 \u0003 0.0625 \u0003 1150 Powers of ten will creep into the ﬁxed- or ﬂoating-point notation if the number is too small or too large to be displayed properly. Scientiﬁc (also called standard) notation and engineering notation make use of powers of ten with restrictions on the mantissa (multiplier) or scale factor (power of the power of ten). Scientiﬁc notation requires that the decimal point appear directly after the ﬁrst digit greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10. A power of ten will then appear with the number (usually following the power notation E), even if it has to be to the zero power. A few examples: \u0003 3.33333333333E\u00021 \u0003 6.25E\u00022 \u0003 1.15E3 Within the scientiﬁc notation, the ﬁxed- or ﬂoating-point format can be chosen. In the above examples, ﬂoating was employed. If ﬁxed is chosen and set at the thousandths-point accuracy, the following will result for the above operations: 2300\u0004 2 1 \u0004 16 1 \u0004 3 2300\u0004 2 1 \u0004 16 1 \u0004 3 2300\u0004 2 1 \u0004 16 1 \u0004 3 \u0001 S I POWERS OF TEN  17 \u0003 3.333E\u00021 \u0003 6.250E\u00022 \u0003 1.150E3 The last format to be introduced is engineering notation, which speciﬁes that all powers of ten must be multiples of 3, and the mantissa must be greater than or equal to 1 but less than 1000. This restriction on the powers of ten is due to the fact that speciﬁc powers of ten have been assigned preﬁxes that will be introduced in the next few paragraphs. Using engineering notation in the ﬂoating-point mode will result in the following for the above operations: \u0003 333.333333333E\u00023 \u0003 62.5E\u00023 \u0003 1.15E3 Using engineering notation with three-place accuracy will result in the following: \u0003 333.333E\u00023 \u0003 62.500E\u00023 \u0003 1.150E3 Preﬁxes Speciﬁc powers of ten in engineering notation have been assigned pre- ﬁxes and symbols, as appearing in Table 1.2.

For instance, if a meter measures kilohertz (kHz), it may be necessary to ﬁnd the corresponding level in megahertz (MHz), or if time is measured in milliseconds (ms), it may be necessary to ﬁnd the corresponding time in microseconds (ms) for a graphical plot. The process is not a difﬁcult one if we simply keep in mind that an increase or a decrease in the power of ten must be associated with the opposite effect on the multiplying factor. The procedure is best described by a few examples. EXAMPLE 1.12 a. Convert 20 kHz to megahertz. b. Convert 0.01 ms to microseconds. c. Convert 0.002 km to millimeters. Solutions: a. In the power-of-ten format: 20 kHz \u0003 20 \u0002 10 3 Hz The conversion requires that we ﬁnd the multiplying factor to appear in the space below: Since the power of ten will be increased by a factor of three, the multiplying factor must be decreased by moving the decimal point three places to the left, as shown below: and 20 \u0002 103 Hz \u0003 0.02 \u0002 10 6 Hz \u0003 0.02 MHz b. In the power-of-ten format: 0.01 ms \u0003 0.01 \u0002 10 \u00063 s and 0.01 \u0004 10 \u00033 s \u0001 \u0004 10\u00036 s Reduce by 3 Increase by 3 020. \u0001 0.02 3 20 \u0004 10 3 Hz7\u0004 106 Hz Increase by 3 Decrease by 3 \u0001 S I CONVERSION WITHIN AND BETWEEN SYSTEMS OF UNITS  19 Since the power of ten will be reduced by a factor of three, the multiplying factor must be increased by moving the decimal point three places to the right, as follows: and 0.01 \u0002 10 \u00063 s \u0003 10 \u0002 10 \u00066 s \u0003 10 ms There is a tendency when comparing \u00063 to \u00066 to think that the power of ten has increased, but keep in mind when making your judgment about increasing or decreasing the magnitude of the multi- plier that 10 \u00066 is a great deal smaller than 10 \u00063. c. In this example we have to be very careful because the difference between \u00053 and \u00063 is a factor of 6, requiring that the multiplying factor be modiﬁed as follows: and 0.002 \u0002 10 3 m \u0003 2000 \u0002 10 \u00063 m \u0003 2000 mm 1.8 CONVERSION WITHIN AND BETWEEN SYSTEMS OF UNITS The conversion within and between systems of units is a process that cannot be avoided in the study of any technical ﬁeld. It is an operation, however, that is performed incorrectly so often that this section was included to provide one approach that, if applied properly, will lead to the correct result. There is more than one method of performing the conversion process. In fact, some people prefer to determine mentally whether the conversion factor is multiplied or divided. This approach is acceptable for some elementary conversions, but it is risky with more complex operations. The procedure to be described here is best introduced by examining a relatively simple problem such as converting inches to meters. Specif- ically, let us convert 48 in. (4 ft) to meters. If we multiply the 48 in. by a factor of 1, the magnitude of the quan- tity remains the same: 48 in. \u0003 48 in.(1) (1.10) Let us now look at the conversion factor, which is the following for this example: 1 m \u0003 39.37 in. Dividing both sides of the conversion factor by 39.37 in. will result in the following format: \u0003 (1) 1 m\u0004\u0004 39.37 in. 0.002000 \u0001 2000 6 0.002 \u0004 10 3 m7\u0004 10\u00033 m Reduce by 6 Increase by 6 0.010 \u0001 10 3 \u0001 S I 20  INTRODUCTION Note that the end result is that the ratio 1 m/39.37 in. equals 1, as it should since they are equal quantities. If we now substitute this factor (1) into Eq. (1.10), we obtain 48 in.(1) \u0003 48 in.\u0001\u0002 which results in the cancellation of inches as a unit of measure and leaves meters as the unit of measure. In addition, since the 39.37 is in the denominator, it must be divided into the 48 to complete the opera- tion: m \u0003 1.219 m Let us now review the method, which has the following steps: 1. Set up the conversion factor to form a numerical value of (1) with the unit of measurement to be removed from the original quantity in the denominator. 2. Perform the required mathematics to obtain the proper magnitude for the remaining unit of measurement. EXAMPLE 1.13 a. Convert 6.8 min to seconds. b. Convert 0.24 m to centimeters. Solutions: a. The conversion factor is 1 min \u0003 60 s Since the minute is to be removed as the unit of measurement, it must appear in the denominator of the (1) factor, as follows: Step 1: \u0001\u0002 \u0003 (1) Step 2: 6.8 min(1) \u0003 6.8 min\u0001\u0002 \u0003 (6.8)(60) s \u0003 408 s b. The conversion factor is 1 m \u0003 100 cm Since the meter is to be removed as the unit of measurement, it must appear in the denominator of the (1) factor as follows: Step 1: \u0001\u0002 \u0003 1 Step 2: 0.24 m(1) \u0003 0.24 m\u0001\u0002 \u0003 (0.24)(100) cm \u0003 24 cm The products (1)(1) and (1)(1)(1) are still 1. Using this fact, we can perform a series of conversions in the same operation. 100 cm\u0004 1 m 100 cm\u0004 1 m 60 s\u0004 1 min 60 s\u0004 1 min 48\u0004 39.37 1 m\u0004\u0004 39.37 in. \u0001 S I SYMBOLS  21 EXAMPLE 1.14 a. Determine the number of minutes in half a day. b. Convert 2.2 yards to meters. Solutions: a. Working our way through from days to hours to minutes, always ensuring that the unit of measurement to be removed is in the denominator, will result in the following sequence: 0.5 day\u0001\u0002\u0001 \u0002 \u0003 (0.5)(24)(60) min \u0003 720 min b.

Inverting the factor 4 min/1 mi to 1 mi/4 min, we can proceed as follows: \u0001\u0002\u0001 \u0002 \u0003 mi/h \u0003 15 mi/h 1.9SYMBOLS Throughout the text, various symbols will be employed that the reader may not have had occasion to use.

However, even though such tables appear easy to use, frequent errors occur because the operations appearing at the head of the table are not performed properly. In any case, when using such tables, try to establish mentally some order of magnitude for the quan- tity to be determined compared to the magnitude of the quantity in its original set of units. This simple operation should prevent several impossible results that may occur if the conversion operation is improp- erly applied. For example, consider the following from such a conversion table: A conversion of 2.5 mi to meters would require that we multiply 2.5 by the conversion factor; that is, 2.5 mi(1.609 \u0002 103) \u0003 4.0225 \u0002 10 3 m A conversion from 4000 m to miles would require a division process: \u0003 2486.02 \u0002 10 \u00063 \u0003 2.48602 mi In each of the above, there should have been little difﬁculty realizing that 2.5 mi would convert to a few thousand meters and 4000 m would be only a few miles. As indicated above, this kind of anticipatory think- ing will eliminate the possibility of ridiculous conversion results. 1.11 CALCULATORS In some texts, the calculator is not discussed in detail. Instead, stu- dents are left with the general exercise of choosing an appropriate cal- culator and learning to use it properly on their own. However, some discussion about the use of the calculator must be included to elimi- nate some of the impossible results obtained (and often strongly defended by the user—because the calculator says so) through a cor- rect understanding of the process by which a calculator performs the various tasks. Time and space do not permit a detailed explanation of all the possible operations, but it is assumed that the following discus- sion will enlighten the user to the fact that it is important to under- stand the manner in which a calculator proceeds with a calculation and not to expect the unit to accept data in any form and always generate the correct answer. When choosing a calculator (scientiﬁc for our use), be absolutely sure that it has the ability to operate on complex numbers (polar and rectangular) which will be described in detail in Chapter 13. For now simply look up the terms in the index of the operator’s manual, and be sure that the terms appear and that the basic operations with them are discussed. Next, be aware that some calculators perform the operations with a minimum number of steps while others can require a downright lengthy or complex series of steps. Speak to your instructor if unsure about your purchase. For this text, the TI-86 of Fig. 1.5 was chosen because of its treatment of complex numbers. 4000 m\u0004\u0004 1.609 \u0002 10 3 Multiply by\u0004\u0004 1.609 \u0002 10 3 To\u0004 Meters To convert from\u0004\u0004 Miles FIG. 1.5 Texas Instruments TI-86 calculator. (Courtesy of Texas Instruments, Inc.) \u0001 S I CALCULATORS  23 Initial Settings Format and accuracy are the ﬁrst two settings that must be made on any scientiﬁc calculator. For most calculators the choices of formats are Normal, Scientiﬁc, and Engineering. For the TI-86 calculator, pressing the 2nd function (yellow) key followed by the key will pro- vide a list of options for the initial settings of the calculator. For calcu- lators without a choice, consult the operator’s manual for the manner in which the format and accuracy level are set. Examples of each are shown below: Normal: 1/3 \u0003 0.33 Scientiﬁc: 1/3 \u0003 3.33E\u00061 Engineering: 1/3 \u0003 333.33E\u00063 Note that the Normal format simply places the decimal point in the most logical location. The Scientiﬁc ensures that the number preceding the decimal point is a single digit followed by the required power of ten. The Engineering format will always ensure that the power of ten is a multiple of 3 (whether it be positive, negative, or zero). In the above examples the accuracy was hundredths place. To set this accuracy for the TI-86 calculator, return to the selection and choose 2 to represent two-place accuracy or hundredths place. Initially you will probably be most comfortable with the Normal mode with hundredths-place accuracy. However, as you begin to analyze networks, you may ﬁnd the Engineering mode more appropriate since you will be working with component levels and results that have powers of ten that have been assigned abbreviations and names. Then again, the Scientiﬁc mode may the best choice for a particular analysis. In any event, take the time now to become familiar with the differences between the various modes, and learn how to set them on your calculator. Order of Operations Although being able to set the format and accuracy is important, these features are not the source of the impossible results that often arise because of improper use of the calculator. Improper results occur pri- marily because users fail to realize that no matter how simple or com- plex an equation, the calculator will perform the required operations in a speciﬁc order. For instance, the operation \u0004 3 \u0005 8 1 \u0004 is often entered as \u0003 \u0004 8 3 \u0004\u0005 1 \u0003 2.67 \u0005 1 \u0003 3.67 which is totally incorrect (2 is the answer). The user must be aware that the calculator will not perform the addi- tion ﬁrst and then the division. In fact, addition and subtraction are the last operations to be performed in any equation. It is therefore very important that the reader carefully study and thoroughly understand the next few paragraphs in order to use the calculator properly. 1. The ﬁrst operations to be performed by a calculator can be set using parentheses ( ). It does not matter which operations are within 8 3 \u0005 1 MODE MODE MODE the parentheses. The parentheses simply dictate that this part of the equation is to be determined ﬁrst. There is no limit to the number of parentheses in each equation—all operations within parentheses will be performed ﬁrst. For instance, for the example above, if parentheses are added as shown below, the addition will be performed ﬁrst and the cor- rect answer obtained: \u0004 (3 \u0005 8 1) \u0004 \u0003 \u0003 \u0004 8 4 \u0004\u0003 2 2. Next, powers and roots are performed, such as x 2, \u0004x\u0005, and so on. 3. Negation (applying a negative sign to a quantity) and single-key operations such as sin, tan\u00061, and so on, are performed. 4. Multiplication and division are then performed. 5. Addition and subtraction are performed last. It may take a few moments and some repetition to remember the order, but at least you are now aware that there is an order to the oper- ations and are aware that ignoring them can result in meaningless results. EXAMPLE 1.16 a. Determine \u0007 \u0004 9 3 \u0004\b b. Find \u0004 3 \u0005 4 9 \u0004 c. Determine \u0004 1 4 \u0004\u0005 \u0004 1 6 \u0004\u0005 \u0004 2 3 \u0004 Solutions: a. The following calculator operations will result in an incorrect answer of 1 because the square-root operation will be performed before the division. \u0003 \u0004 \u0004 39\u0005 \u0004 \u0003 \u0004 3 3 \u0004\u0003 1 However, recognizing that we must ﬁrst divide 9 by 3, we can use parentheses as follows to deﬁne this operation as the ﬁrst to be per- formed, and the correct answer will be obtained: \u0003 \u0007\u0001\u0004\b 9 3 \u0004\b\u0002\b\u0003 \u00043\u0005\u0003 1.67 b. If the problem is entered as it appears, the incorrect answer of 5.25 will result. \u0003 3 \u0005 \u0004 9 4 \u0004\u0003 5.25 Using brackets to ensure that the addition takes place before the divi- sion will result in the correct answer as shown below: \u0003 \u0004 (3 \u0005 4 9) \u0004 \u0003 \u0004 1 4 2 \u0004\u0003 343 \u0005( )9 493 \u0005 93 √ () 9 √ 3 3 \u0005( )18 \u0001 S I 24  INTRODUCTION c. Since the division will occur ﬁrst, the correct result will be obtained by simply performing the operations as indicated. That is, \u0003 \u0004 1 4 \u0004\u0005 \u0004 1 6 \u0004\u0005 \u0004 2 3 \u0004\u0003 1.08 1.12 COMPUTER ANALYSIS The use of computers in the educational process has grown expo- nentially in the past decade. Very few texts at this introductory level fail to include some discussion of current popular computer techniques. In fact, the very accreditation of a technology program may be a func- tion of the depth to which computer methods are incorporated in the program. There is no question that a basic knowledge of computer methods is something that the graduating student should carry away from a two- year or four-year program. Industry is now expecting students to have a basic knowledge of computer jargon and some hands-on experience. For some students, the thought of having to become proﬁcient in the use of a computer may result in an insecure, uncomfortable feeling. Be assured, however, that through the proper learning experience and expo- sure, the computer can become a very “friendly,” useful, and supportive tool in the development and application of your technical skills in a pro- fessional environment. For the new student of computers, two general directions can be taken to develop the necessary computer skills: the study of computer languages or the use of software packages. Languages There are several languages that provide a direct line of communication with the computer and the operations it can perform. A language is a set of symbols, letters, words, or statements that the user can enter into the computer. The computer system will “understand” these entries and will perform them in the order established by a series of commands called a program. The program tells the computer what to do on a sequential, line-by-line basis in the same order a student would perform the calculations in longhand. The computer can respond only to the commands entered by the user. This requires that the programmer understand fully the sequence of operations and calculations required to obtain a particular solution. In other words, the computer can only respond to the user’s input—it does not have some mysterious way of providing solutions unless told how to obtain those solutions. A lengthy analysis can result in a program having hundreds or thousands of lines. Once written, the program has to be checked carefully to be sure the results have meaning and are valid for an expected range of input vari- ables. Writing a program can, therefore, be a long, tedious process, but keep in mind that once the program has been tested and proven true, it can be stored in memory for future use. The user can be assured that any future results obtained have a high degree of accuracy but require a minimum expenditure of energy and time. Some of the popular lan- guages applied in the electrical/electronics ﬁeld today include C\u0005\u0005, QBASIC, Pascal, and FORTRAN. Each has its own set of commands and statements to communicate with the computer, but each can be used to perform the same type of analysis. \u00054 \u00056 1 3 21 COMPUTER ANALYSIS  25\u0001 S I \u0001 S I 26  INTRODUCTION This text includes C\u0003\u0003 in its development because of its growing popularity in the educational community. The C language was ﬁrst developed at Bell Laboratories to establish an efﬁcient communication link between the user and the machine language of the central process- ing unit (CPU) of a computer. The language has grown in popularity throughout industry and education because it has the characteristics of a high-level language (easily understood by the user) with an efﬁcient link to the computer’s operating system. The C\u0005\u0005 language was intro- duced as an extension of the C language to assist in the writing of com- plex programs using an enhanced, modular, top-down approach. In any event, it is not assumed that the coverage of C\u0005\u0005 in this text is sufﬁcient to permit the writing of additional programs. The inclusion is meant as an introduction only: to reveal the appearance and charac- teristics of the language, and to follow the development of some simple programs. A proper exposure to C\u0005\u0005 would require a course in itself, or at least a comprehensive supplemental program to ﬁll in the many gaps of this text’s presentation. Software Packages The second approach to computer analysis—software packages— avoids the need to know a particular language; in fact, the user may not be aware of which language was used to write the programs within the package. All that is required is a knowledge of how to input the network parameters, deﬁne the operations to be performed, and extract the results; the package will do the rest. The individual steps toward a solu- tion are beyond the needs of the user—all the user needs is an idea of how to get the network parameters into the computer and how to extract the results. Herein lie two of the concerns of the author with packaged programs—obtaining a solution without the faintest idea of either how the solution was obtained or whether the results are valid or way off base. It is imperative that the student realize that the computer should be used as a tool to assist the user—it must not be allowed to control the scope and potential of the user! Therefore, as we progress through the chapters of the text, be sure that concepts are clearly understood before turning to the computer for support and efﬁciency. Each software package has a menu, which deﬁnes the range of application of the package. Once the software is entered into the com- puter, the system will perform all the functions appearing in the menu, as it was preprogrammed to do. Be aware, however, that if a particular type of analysis is requested that is not on the menu, the software pack- age cannot provide the desired results. The package is limited solely to those maneuvers developed by the team of programmers who devel- oped the software package. In such situations the user must turn to another software package or write a program using one of the languages listed above. In broad terms, if a software package is available to perform a particular analysis, then it should be used rather than developing rou- tines. Most popular software packages are the result of many hours of effort by teams of programmers with years of experience. How- ever, if the results are not in the desired format, or if the software package does not provide all the desired results, then the user’s inno- vative talents should be put to use to develop a software package. As noted above, any program the user writes that passes the tests of range and accuracy can be considered a software package of his or her authorship for future use. 26  INTRODUCTION \u0001 S I Three software packages will be used throughout this text: Cadence’s OrCAD PSpice 9.2, Electronics Workbench’s Multisim, and MathSoft’s Mathcad 2000, all of which appear in Fig. 1.6. Although PSpice and Electronics Workbench are both designed to analyze elec- tric circuits, there are sufﬁcient differences between the two to warrant covering each approach separately. The growing use of some form of mathematical support in the educational and industrial environment jus- tiﬁes the introduction and use of Mathcad throughout the text. There is no requirement that the student obtain all three to proceed with the con- tent of this text. The primary reason for their inclusion was simply to introduce each and demonstrate how they can support the learning process. In most cases, sufﬁcient detail has been provided to actually use the software package to perform the examples provided, although it would certainly be helpful to have someone to turn to if questions arise. In addition, the literature supporting all three packages has improved dramatically in recent years and should be available through your book- store or a major publisher. Appendix A lists all the system requirements, including how to get in touch with each company.

The simplest of all atoms is the hydrogen atom, made up of two basic parti- cles, the proton and the electron, in the relative positions shown in Fig. 2.1(a). The nucleus of the hydrogen atom is the proton, a positively charged particle. The orbiting electron carries a negative charge that is equal in magnitude to the positive charge of the proton. In all other ele- e I V + Electron Nucleus Proton – + + – – Protons Electrons Nucleus Neutrons Electron (b) Helium atom (a) Hydrogen atom FIG. 2.1 The hydrogen and helium atoms. 2 FIG. 2.2 Shells and subshells of the atomic structure. 2 electrons (2 e)2 e 6 e 2 e 6 e 10 e 2 e 6 e 10 e 14 e ss p s p d s p d f 4th shell3rd shell2nd shell1st shell 1 subshell 2 subshells 3 subshells 4 subshells nl Nucleus + k m ments, the nucleus also contains neutrons, which are slightly heavier than protons and have no electrical charge. The helium atom, for exam- ple, has two neutrons in addition to two electrons and two protons, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b). In all neutral atoms the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. The mass of the electron is 9.11 \u0001 10 \u000228 g, and that of the proton and neutron is 1.672 \u0001 10 \u000224 g. The mass of the proton (or neutron) is therefore approximately 1836 times that of the electron. The radii of the proton, neutron, and electron are all of the order of magnitude of 2 \u0001 10\u000215 m. For the hydrogen atom, the radius of the smallest orbit followed by the electron is about 5 \u0001 10 \u000211 m. The radius of this orbit is approxi- mately 25,000 times that of the radius of the electron, proton, or neu- tron. This is approximately equivalent to a sphere the size of a dime revolving about another sphere of the same size more than a quarter of a mile away. Different atoms will have various numbers of electrons in the con- centric shells about the nucleus. The ﬁrst shell, which is closest to the nucleus, can contain only two electrons. If an atom should have three electrons, the third must go to the next shell. The second shell can con- tain a maximum of eight electrons; the third, 18; and the fourth, 32; as determined by the equation 2n 2, where n is the shell number. These shells are usually denoted by a number (n \u0003 1, 2, 3, . . .) or letter (n \u0003 k, l, m, .. .). Each shell is then broken down into subshells, where the ﬁrst sub- shell can contain a maximum of two electrons; the second subshell, six electrons; the third, 10 electrons; and the fourth, 14; as shown in Fig. 2.2. The subshells are usually denoted by the letters s, p, d, and f, in that order, outward from the nucleus. 32  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V It has been determined by experimentation that unlike charges attract, and like charges repel. The force of attraction or repulsion between two charged bodies Q1 and Q2 can be determined by Coulomb’s law: (newtons, N) (2.1) where F is in newtons, k \u0003 a constant \u0003 9.0 \u0001 10 9 N⋅m 2/C 2, Q1 and Q2 are the charges in coulombs (to be introduced in Section 2.2), and r is F (attraction or repulsion) \u0003 \u0004 kQ r 1 2 Q2\u0004 French (Angoulème, Paris) (1736–1806) Scientist and Inventor Military Engineer, West Indies Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 52,597 Attended the engineering school at Mezieres, the ﬁrst such school of its kind.

At room temperature with no external forces applied, there exists within the copper wire the random motion of free electrons created by the distance in meters between the two charges. In particular, note the squared r term in the denominator, resulting in rapidly decreasing lev- els of F for increasing values of r. (See Fig. 2.3.) In the atom, therefore, electrons will repel each other, and protons and electrons will attract each other. Since the nucleus consists of many positive charges (protons), a strong attractive force exists for the elec- trons in orbits close to the nucleus [note the effects of a large charge Q and a small distance r in Eq. (2.1)]. As the distance between the nucleus and the orbital electrons increases, the binding force diminishes until it reaches its lowest level at the outermost subshell (largest r). Due to the weaker binding forces, less energy must be expended to remove an electron from an outer subshell than from an inner subshell. Also, it is generally true that electrons are more readily removed from atoms hav- ing outer subshells that are incomplete and, in addition, possess few electrons. These properties of the atom that permit the removal of elec- trons under certain conditions are essential if motion of charge is to be created. Without this motion, this text could venture no further—our basic quantities rely on it. Copper is the most commonly used metal in the electrical/electron- ics industry. An examination of its atomic structure will help identify why it has such widespread applications. The copper atom (Fig. 2.4) has one more electron than needed to complete the ﬁrst three shells. This incomplete outermost subshell, possessing only one electron, and the distance between this electron and the nucleus reveal that the twenty-ninth electron is loosely bound to the copper atom. If this twenty-ninth electron gains sufﬁcient energy from the surrounding medium to leave its parent atom, it is called a free electron. In one cubic inch of copper at room temperature, there are approximately 1.4 \u0001 10\u000524 free electrons. Other metals that exhibit the same proper- ties as copper, but to a different degree, are silver, gold, aluminum, and tungsten. Additional discussion of conductors and their characteristics can be found in Section 3.2. FIG. 2.3 Charles Augustin de Coulomb. e I V34  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE the thermal energy that the electrons gain from the surrounding medium. When atoms lose their free electrons, they acquire a net pos- itive charge and are referred to as positive ions. The free electrons are able to move within these positive ions and leave the general area of the parent atom, while the positive ions only oscillate in a mean ﬁxed position. For this reason, the free electron is the charge carrier in a copper wire or any other solid conductor of electricity. An array of positive ions and free electrons is depicted in Fig. 2.6. Within this array, the free electrons ﬁnd themselves continually gaining or losing energy by virtue of their changing direction and velocity. Some of the factors responsible for this random motion include (1) the collisions with positive ions and other electrons, (2) the attractive forces for the positive ions, and (3) the force of repulsion that exists between electrons. This random motion of free electrons is such that over a period of time, the number of electrons moving to the right across the circular cross section of Fig. 2.5 is exactly equal to the number passing over to the left. With no external forces applied, the net ﬂow of charge in a conductor in any one direction is zero. Let us now connect copper wire between two battery terminals and a light bulb, as shown in Fig. 2.7, to create the simplest of electric cir- cuits. The battery, at the expense of chemical energy, places a net posi- tive charge at one terminal and a net negative charge on the other. The instant the ﬁnal connection is made, the free electrons (of negative charge) will drift toward the positive terminal, while the positive ions left behind in the copper wire will simply oscillate in a mean ﬁxed posi- tion. The negative terminal is a “supply” of electrons to be drawn from when the electrons of the copper wire drift toward the positive terminal. e e e e e e + Ion + Ion + Ion + Ion + Ion + Ion FIG. 2.6 Random motion of free electrons in an atomic structure.

French (Lyon, Paris) (1775–1836) Mathematician and Physicist Professor of Mathematics, École Polytechnique in Paris Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 76,524 On September 18, 1820, introduced a new ﬁeld of study, electrodynamics, devoted to the effect of elec- tricity in motion, including the interaction between currents in adjoining conductors and the interplay of the surrounding magnetic ﬁelds. Constructed the ﬁrst solenoid and demonstrated how it could behave like a magnet (the ﬁrst electromagnet). Suggested the name galvanometer for an instrument designed to measure current levels. e I V The chemical activity of the battery will absorb the electrons at the pos- itive terminal and will maintain a steady supply of electrons at the neg- ative terminal. The ﬂow of charge (electrons) through the bulb will heat up the ﬁlament of the bulb through friction to the point that it will glow red hot and emit the desired light. If 6.242 \u0001 10 18 electrons drift at uniform velocity through the imag- inary circular cross section of Fig. 2.7 in 1 second, the ﬂow of charge, or current, is said to be 1 ampere (A) in honor of André Marie Ampère (Fig. 2.8). The discussion of Chapter 1 clearly reveals that this is an enormous number of electrons passing through the surface in 1 second. The current associated with only a few electrons per second would be inconsequential and of little practical value. To establish numerical val- ues that permit immediate comparisons between levels, a coulomb (C) of charge was deﬁned as the total charge associated with 6.242 \u0001 1018 electrons. The charge associated with one electron can then be deter- mined from Charge/electron \u0003 Qe \u0003\u0003 1.6 \u0001 10 \u000219 C The current in amperes can now be calculated using the following equation: I \u0003 amperes (A) Q \u0003 coulombs (C) (2.2) t \u0003 seconds (s) The capital letter I was chosen from the French word for current: inten- sité. The SI abbreviation for each quantity in Eq. (2.2) is provided to the right of the equation. The equation clearly reveals that for equal time intervals, the more charge that ﬂows through the wire, the heavier the current. Through algebraic manipulations, the other two quantities can be determined as follows: (coulombs, C) (2.3) and (seconds, s) (2.4) EXAMPLE 2.1 The charge ﬂowing through the imaginary surface of Fig. 2.7 is 0.16 C every 64 ms.

Calculate t [Eq. (2.4)]: t \u0003\u0003 \u0003 1.282 s A second glance at Fig. 2.7 will reveal that two directions of charge ﬂow have been indicated. One is called conventional ﬂow, and the other is called electron ﬂow. This text will deal only with conventional ﬂow for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it is the most widely used at educational institutions and in industry, it is employed in the design of all electronic device symbols, and it is the popular choice for all major computer software packages. The ﬂow controversy is a result of an assumption made at the time electricity was discovered that the positive charge was the moving particle in metallic conductors. Be assured that the choice of conventional ﬂow will not create great difﬁ- culty and confusion in the chapters to follow. Once the direction of I is established, the issue is dropped and the analysis can continue without confusion. Safety Considerations It is important to realize that even small levels of current through the human body can cause serious, dangerous side effects. Experimental results reveal that the human body begins to react to currents of only a few milliamperes. Although most individuals can withstand currents up to perhaps 10 mA for very short periods of time without serious side effects, any current over 10 mA should be considered dangerous. In fact, currents of 50 mA can cause severe shock, and currents of over 100 mA can be fatal. In most cases the skin resistance of the body when dry is sufﬁciently high to limit the current through the body to relatively safe levels for voltage levels typically found in the home. However, be aware that when the skin is wet due to perspiration, bathing, etc., or when the skin barrier is broken due to an injury, the skin resistance drops dramatically, and current levels could rise to dangerous levels for the same voltage shock. In general, therefore, simply remember that water and electricity don’t mix. Granted, there are safety devices in the home today [such as the ground fault current interrupt (GFCI) breaker to be introduced in Chapter 4] that are designed speciﬁcally for use in wet areas such as the bathroom and kitchen, but accidents happen. Treat electricity with respect—not fear. 2.3 VOLTAGE The ﬂow of charge described in the previous section is established by an external “pressure” derived from the energy that a mass has by virtue of its position: potential energy. Energy, by deﬁnition, is the capacity to do work. If a mass (m) is raised to some height (h) above a reference plane, it has a measure of potential energy expressed in joules (J) that is determined by (joules, J) (2.5) where g is the gravitational acceleration (9.754 m/s 2). This mass now has the “potential” to do work such as crush an object placed on the ref- W (potential energy) \u0003 mgh 6.41 \u0001 10 \u00023 C\u0004\u0004 5 \u0001 10 \u00023 A Q\u0004 I 36  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V e I V erence plane. If the weight is raised further, it has an increased measure of potential energy and can do additional work. There is an obvious dif- ference in potential between the two heights above the reference plane. In the battery of Fig. 2.7, the internal chemical action will establish (through an expenditure of energy) an accumulation of negative charges (electrons) on one terminal (the negative terminal) and positive charges (positive ions) on the other (the positive terminal). A “positioning” of the charges has been established that will result in a potential differ- ence between the terminals. If a conductor is connected between the terminals of the battery, the electrons at the negative terminal have suf- ﬁcient potential energy to overcome collisions with other particles in the conductor and the repulsion from similar charges to reach the posi- tive terminal to which they are attracted. Charge can be raised to a higher potential level through the expendi- ture of energy from an external source, or it can lose potential energy as it travels through an electrical system. In any case, by deﬁnition: A potential difference of 1 volt (V) exists between two points if 1 joule (J) of energy is exchanged in moving 1 coulomb (C) of charge between the two points. The unit of measurement volt was chosen to honor Alessandro Volta (Fig. 2.9). Pictorially, if one joule of energy (1 J) is required to move the one coulomb (1 C) of charge of Fig. 2.10 from position x to position y, the potential difference or voltage between the two points is one volt (1 V). If the energy required to move the 1 C of charge increases to 12 J due to additional opposing forces, then the potential difference will increase to 12 V. Voltage is therefore an indication of how much energy is involved in moving a charge between two points in an electrical system. Conversely, the higher the voltage rating of an energy source such as a battery, the more energy will be available to move charge through the system. Note in the above discussion that two points are always involved when talking about voltage or potential difference. In the future, therefore, it is very important to keep in mind that a potential difference or voltage is always measured between two points in the system. Changing either point may change the potential difference between the two points under investigation. In general, the potential difference between two points is deter- mined by (volts) (2.6) Through algebraic manipulations, we have (joules) (2.7) and (coulombs) (2.8)Q \u0003 \u0004 W V \u0004 W \u0003 QV V \u0003 \u0004 W Q \u0004 VOLTAGE  37 e I V Vxy = 1 volt 1 C W = 1 J xy FIG. 2.10 Deﬁning the unit of measurement for voltage.

Italian (Como, Pavia) (1745–1827) Physicist Professor of Physics, Pavia, Italy Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 55,393 Began electrical experiments at the age of 18 work- ing with other European investigators. Major contri- bution was the development of an electrical energy source from chemical action in 1800. For the ﬁrst time, electrical energy was available on a continu- ous basis and could be used for practical purposes. Developed the ﬁrst condenser known today as the capacitor. Was invited to Paris to demonstrate the voltaic cell to Napoleon. The International Electri- cal Congress meeting in Paris in 1881 honored his efforts by choosing the volt as the unit of measure for electromotive force. EXAMPLE 2.3 Find the potential difference between two points in an electrical system if 60 J of energy are expended by a charge of 20 C between these two points. Solution: Eq. (2.6): V \u0003\u0003 \u0003 3 V EXAMPLE 2.4 Determine the energy expended moving a charge of 50 mC through a potential difference of 6 V. Solution: Eq.

To distinguish between sources of voltage (batteries and the like) and losses in potential across dissipative elements, the fol- lowing notation will be used: E for voltage sources (volts) V for voltage drops (volts) An occasional source of confusion is the terminology applied to this subject matter. Terms commonly encountered include potential, poten- tial difference, voltage, voltage difference (drop or rise), and electro- motive force. As noted in the description above, some are used inter- changeably. The following deﬁnitions are provided as an aid in understanding the meaning of each term: Potential: The voltage at a point with respect to another point in the electrical system. Typically the reference point is ground, which is at zero potential. Potential difference: The algebraic difference in potential (or voltage) between two points of a network. Voltage: When isolated, like potential, the voltage at a point with respect to some reference such as ground (0 V). Voltage difference: The algebraic difference in voltage (or potential) between two points of the system. A voltage drop or rise is as the terminology would suggest. Electromotive force (emf): The force that establishes the ﬂow of charge (or current) in a system due to the application of a difference in potential. This term is not applied that often in today’s literature but is associated primarily with sources of energy. In summary, the applied potential difference (in volts) of a voltage source in an electric circuit is the “pressure” to set the system in motion and “cause” the ﬂow of charge or current through the electrical system. A mechanical analogy of the applied voltage is the pressure applied to the water in a main. The resulting ﬂow of water through the system is likened to the ﬂow of charge through an electric circuit. Without the applied pressure from the spigot, the water will simply sit in the hose, just as the electrons of a copper wire do not have a general direction without an applied voltage. 60 J\u0004 20 C W\u0004 Q 38  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V e I V 2.4 FIXED (dc) SUPPLIES The terminology dc employed in the heading of this section is an abbre- viation for direct current, which encompasses the various electrical sys- tems in which there is a unidirectional (“one direction”) ﬂow of charge. A great deal more will be said about this terminology in the chapters to follow. For now, we will consider only those supplies that provide a ﬁxed voltage or current. dc Voltage Sources Since the dc voltage source is the more familiar of the two types of sup- plies, it will be examined ﬁrst. The symbol used for all dc voltage sup- plies in this text appears in Fig. 2.11. The relative lengths of the bars indicate the terminals they represent. Dc voltage sources can be divided into three broad categories: (1) batteries (chemical action), (2) generators (electromechanical), and (3) power supplies (rectiﬁcation). Batteries General Information For the layperson, the battery is the most com- mon of the dc sources. By deﬁnition, a battery (derived from the expression “battery of cells”) consists of a combination of two or more similar cells, a cell being the fundamental source of electrical energy developed through the conversion of chemical or solar energy. All cells can be divided into the primary or secondary types. The secondary is rechargeable, whereas the primary is not. That is, the chemical reaction of the secondary cell can be reversed to restore its capacity. The two most common rechargeable batteries are the lead-acid unit (used pri- marily in automobiles) and the nickel-cadmium battery (used in calcu- lators, tools, photoﬂash units, shavers, and so on). The obvious advan- tage of the rechargeable unit is the reduced costs associated with not having to continually replace discharged primary cells. All the cells appearing in this chapter except the solar cell, which absorbs energy from incident light in the form of photons, establish a potential difference at the expense of chemical energy. In addition, each has a positive and a negative electrode and an electrolyte to complete the circuit between electrodes within the battery. The electrolyte is the contact element and the source of ions for conduction between the ter- minals. Alkaline and Lithium-Iodine Primary Cells The popular alkaline primary battery employs a powdered zinc anode (\u0005); a potassium (alkali metal) hydroxide electrolyte; and a manganese dioxide, carbon cathode (\u0002) as shown in Fig. 2.12(a). In particular, note in Fig. 2.12(b) that the larger the cylindrical unit, the higher the current capacity. The lantern is designed primarily for long-term use. Figure 2.13 shows two lithium-iodine primary units with an area of application and a rating to be introduced later in this section. Lead-Acid Secondary Cell For the secondary lead-acid unit appear- ing in Fig. 2.14, the electrolyte is sulfuric acid, and the electrodes are spongy lead (Pb) and lead peroxide (PbO2). When a load is applied to the battery terminals, there is a transfer of electrons from the spongy lead electrode to the lead peroxide electrode through the load. This FIXED (dc) SUPPLIES  39 e I V +– E FIG. 2.11 Symbol for a dc voltage source. transfer of electrons will continue until the battery is completely dis- charged. The discharge time is determined by how diluted the acid has become and how heavy the coating of lead sulfate is on each plate. The state of discharge of a lead storage cell can be determined by measur- ing the speciﬁc gravity of the electrolyte with a hydrometer. The spe- ciﬁc gravity of a substance is deﬁned to be the ratio of the weight of a given volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of water at 4°C. For fully charged batteries, the speciﬁc gravity should be somewhere between 1.28 and 1.30. When the speciﬁc gravity drops to about 1.1, the battery should be recharged. Since the lead storage cell is a secondary cell, it can be recharged at any point during the discharge phase simply by applying an external dc current source across the cell that will pass current through the cell in a direction opposite to that in which the cell supplied current to the 40  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V (b) 1.5 V “C” cell 1.5 V “D” cell 1.5 V “AAA” cell 1.5 V “AA” cell 9 V transistor 6 V lantern [7.2 Ah] (0–1 A) [16.0 Ah] (0–1 A) Capacity Continuous Current [1.1 Ah] (0–300 mA) [2.5 Ah] (0–500 mA) [520 mAh] (0–250 mA) [22.0 Ah] (0–1.5 A) Capacity Continuous Current (a) Metal spur Rivet — brass Negative cover — plated steel Can — steel Metallized plastic film label Anode — powdered zinc Current collector — brass Seal — nylon Inner cell cover — steel Positive cover — plated steel Electrolyte — potassium hydroxide Cathode — manganese dioxide, carbon Separator — non-woven fabric Metal washer FIG. 2.12 (a) Cutaway of cylindrical Energizer® alkaline cell; (b) Eveready ® Energizer primary cells.

This will remove the lead sulfate from the plates and restore the concentration of sulfuric acid. The output of a lead storage cell over most of the discharge phase is about 2.1 V. In the commercial lead storage batteries used in the auto- mobile, 12.6 V can be produced by six cells in series, as shown in Fig. 2.14. In general, lead-acid storage batteries are used in situations where a high current is required for relatively short periods of time. At one time all lead-acid batteries were vented. Gases created during the dis- charge cycle could escape, and the vent plugs provided access to replace the water or electrolyte and to check the acid level with a hydrometer. The use of a grid made from a wrought lead–calcium alloy strip rather than the lead-antimony cast grid commonly used has resulted in maintenance-free batteries such as that appearing in Fig. 2.14. The lead-antimony structure was susceptible to corrosion, over- charge, gasing, water usage, and self-discharge. Improved design with the lead-calcium grid has either eliminated or substantially reduced most of these problems. It would seem that with all the years of technology surrounding bat- teries, smaller, more powerful units would now be available. However, when it comes to the electric car, which is slowly gaining interest and popularity throughout the world, the lead-acid battery is still the pri- mary source of power. A “station car,” manufactured in Norway and used on a test basis in San Francisco for typical commuter runs, has a total weight of 1650 pounds, with 550 pounds (a third of its weight) for the lead-acid rechargeable batteries. Although the station car will travel at speeds of 55 mph, its range is limited to 65 miles on a charge. It would appear that long-distance travel with signiﬁcantly reduced weight factors for the batteries will depend on a new, innovative approach to battery design. Nickel-Cadmium Secondary-Cell The nickel-cadmium battery is a rechargeable battery that has been receiving enormous interest and FIXED (dc) SUPPLIES  41 e I V + − 12.6 V FIG. 2.14 Maintenance-free 12-V (actually 12.6-V) lead-acid battery. (Courtesy of Delco- Remy, a division of General Motors Corp.) development in recent years. For applications such as ﬂashlights, shavers, portable televisions, power drills, and so on, the nickel- cadmium (Ni-Cad) battery of Fig. 2.15 is the secondary battery of choice because the current levels are lower and the period of continu- ous drain is usually longer. A typical nickel-cadmium battery can sur- vive over 1000 charge/discharge cycles over a period of time that can last for years. It is important to recognize that when an appliance or a system calls for a Ni-Cad battery, a primary cell should not be used. The appliance or system may have an internal charging network that would be dys- functional with a primary cell. In addition, be aware that all Ni-Cad bat- teries are about 1.2 V per cell, while the most common primary cells are typically 1.5 V per cell. There is some ambiguity about how often a secondary cell should be recharged. For the vast majority of situations, the battery can be used until there is some indication that the energy level is low, such as a dimming light from a ﬂashlight, less power from a drill, or a blinking light if one is provided with the equipment. Keep in mind that secondary cells do have some “memory.” If they are recharged continuously after being used for a short period of time, they may begin to believe they are short-term units and actually fail to hold the charge for the rated period of time. In any event, always try to avoid a “hard” discharge, which results when every bit of energy is drained from a cell. Too many hard discharge cycles will reduce the cycle life of the battery. Finally, be aware that the charging mechanism for nickel-cadmium cells is quite different from that for lead-acid batter- ies. The nickel-cadmium battery is charged by a constant current source, with the terminal voltage staying pretty steady through the entire charging cycle. The lead-acid battery is charged by a constant voltage source, permitting the current to vary as determined by the state of the battery. The capacity of the Ni-Cad battery increases almost lin- early throughout most of the charging cycle. One may ﬁnd that Ni-Cad 42  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V 1.2 V 4 Ah 1.2 V 1.2 7.2 V 100 mAh 1.2 V 500 mAh 1.2 V 180 mAh Eveready BH 500 cell 1.2 V, 500 mAh App: Where vertical height is severe limitation (a) (b) FIG. 2.15 Rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. (Courtesy of Eveready Batteries.) e I V batteries are relatively warm when charging. The lower the capacity level of the battery when charging, the higher the temperature of the cell. As the battery approaches rated capacity, the temperature of the cell approaches room temperature. Nickel-Hydrogen and Nickel–Metal Hydride Secondary Cells Two other types of secondary cell include the nickel-hydrogen and nickel–metal hydride cells. The nickel-hydrogen cell is currently lim- ited primarily to space vehicle applications where high-energy-density batteries are required that are rugged and reliable and can withstand a high number of charge/discharge cycles over a relatively long period of time. The nickel–metal hydride cell is actually a hybrid of the nickel- cadmium and nickel-hydrogen cells, combining the positive character- istics of each to create a product with a high power level in a small package that has a long cycle life. Although relatively expensive, this hybrid is a valid option for applications such as portable computers, as shown in Fig. 2.16. Solar Cell A high-density, 40-W solar cell appears in Fig. 2.17 with some of its associated data and areas of application. Since the maxi- mum available wattage in an average bright sunlit day is 100 mW/cm2, and since conversion efﬁciencies are currently between 10% and 14%, the maximum available power per square centimeter from most com- mercial units is between 10 mW and 14 mW. For a square meter, how- ever, the return would be 100 W to 140 W. A more detailed description of the solar cell will appear in your electronics courses. For now it is important to realize that a ﬁxed illumination of the solar cell will pro- vide a fairly steady dc voltage for driving various loads, from watches to automobiles. Ampere-Hour Rating Batteries have a capacity rating given in ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh). Some of these ratings are included in the above ﬁgures. A battery with an ampere-hour rat- ing of 100 will theoretically provide a steady current of 1 A for 100 h, 2 A for 50 h, 10 A for 10 h, and so on, as determined by the following equation: Life (hours) \u0003 (2.9) Two factors that affect this rating, however, are the temperature and the rate of discharge. The disc-type Eveready ® BH 500 cell appearing in Fig. 2.15 has the terminal characteristics appearing in Fig. 2.18. Fig- ure 2.18 reveals that the capacity of a dc battery decreases with an increase in the current demand and the capacity of a dc battery decreases at relatively (compared to room temperature) low and high temperatures. Forthe 1-V unit of Fig. 2.18(a), the rating is just above 500 mAh at a discharge current of 100 mA, but it drops to about 300 mAh at about 1 A. Fora unit that is less than 1 1⁄2 in. in diameter and less than 1⁄2 in. in thickness, however, these are excellent terminal characteristics.

(Courtesy of Motorola Semiconductor Products.) 40-W, high-density solar module 100-mm \u0001 100-mm (4\u0006\u0001 4\u0006) square cells are used to provide maximum power in a minimum of space. The 33 series cell module provides a strong 12-V battery charging current for a wide range of temperatures (\u000240°C to 60°C) 2.18(b) reveals that the maximum mAh rating (at a current drain of 50 mA) occurs at about 75°F (\u000324°C), or just above average room tem- perature. Note that the curve drops to the right and left of this maxi- mum value. We are all aware of the reduced “strength” of a battery at low temperatures. Note that it has dropped to almost 300 mAh at about \u00028°F. Another curve of interest appears in Fig. 2.19. It provides the expected cell voltage at a particular drain over a period of hours of use. It is noteworthy that the loss in hours between 50 mA and 100 mA is much greater than between 100 mA and 150 mA, even though the increase in current is the same between levels. In general, the terminal voltage of a dc battery decreases with the length of the discharge time at a particular drain current. 44  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200Capacity (mAh) Discharge current (mA) 600 500 400 300 200 100 600 500 400 300 200 100 0.9 V 1.0 V 1.1 V Discharge current = 50 mA 0°C °F 0 –10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100110120130 (a) (b)Capacity (mAh) FIG. 2.18 Eveready® BH 500 cell characteristics: (a) capacity versus discharge current; (b) capacity versus temperature.

At what temperature will the mAh rating of the cell of Fig. 2.18(b) be 90% of its maximum value if the discharge current is 50 mA? Solutions: a. From Fig. 2.18(a), the capacity at 600 mA is about 450 mAh. Thus, from Eq. (2.9), Life \u0003\u0003 0.75 h \u0003 45 min b. From Fig. 2.18(b), the maximum is approximately 520 mAh. The 90% level is therefore 468 mAh, which occurs just above freezing, or 1°C, and at the higher temperature of 45°C. Generators The dc generator is quite different, both in construc- tion (Fig. 2.20) and in mode of operation, from the battery. When the shaft of the generator is rotating at the nameplate speed due to the applied torque of some external source of mechanical power, a voltage of rated value will appear across the external terminals. The terminal voltage and power-handling capabilities of the dc generator are typi- cally higher than those of most batteries, and its lifetime is determined only by its construction. Commercially used dc generators are typically of the 120-V or 240-V variety. As pointed out earlier in this section, for the purposes of this text, no distinction will be made between the sym- bols for a battery and a generator. Power Supplies The dc supply encountered most frequently in the laboratory employs the rectiﬁcation and ﬁltering processes as its means toward obtaining a steady dc voltage. Both processes will be covered in detail in your basic electronics courses. In total, a time-varying voltage (such as ac voltage available from a home outlet) is converted to one of a ﬁxed magnitude. A dc laboratory supply of this type appears in Fig. 2.21. Most dc laboratory supplies have a regulated, adjustable voltage out- put with three available terminals, as indicated in Figs. 2.21 and 2.22(a). The symbol for ground or zero potential (the reference) is also shown in Fig. 2.22(a). If 10 V above ground potential are required, then the con- nections are made as shown in Fig. 2.22(b). If 15 V below ground potential are required, then the connections are made as shown in Fig. 2.22(c). If connections are as shown in Fig. 2.22(d), we say we have a “ﬂoating” voltage of 5 V since the reference level is not included. Sel- dom is the conﬁguration of Fig. 2.22(d) employed since it fails to pro- tect the operator by providing a direct low-resistance path to ground and to establish a common ground for the system. In any case, the positive and negative terminals must be part of any circuit conﬁguration. dc Current Sources The wide variety of types of, and applications for, the dc voltage source has resulted in its becoming a rather familiar device, the characteristics of which are understood, at least basically, by the layperson. For exam- ple, it is common knowledge that a 12-V car battery has a terminal volt- 450 mAh\u0004\u0004 600 mA FIXED (dc) SUPPLIES  45 e I V 120 V + – Applied torque “Input” “Output” voltage FIG. 2.20 dc generator. FIG. 2.21 dc laboratory supply. (Courtesy of Leader Instruments Corporation.) age (at least approximately) of 12 V, even though the current drain by the automobile may vary under different operating conditions. In other words, a dc voltage source will provide ideally a ﬁxed terminal voltage, even though the current demand from the electrical/electronic system may vary, as depicted in Fig. 2.23(a). A dc current source is the dual of the voltage source; that is, the current source will supply, ideally, a ﬁxed current to an electrical/electronic system, even though there may be variations in the terminal voltage as determined by the system, as depicted in Fig. 2.23(b). Do not become alarmed if the concept of a current source is strange and somewhat confusing at this point. It will be covered in great detail in later chapters. Also, additional exposure will be provided in basic electronics courses. 2.5 CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS Different wires placed across the same two battery terminals will allow different amounts of charge to ﬂow between the terminals. Many fac- tors, such as the density, mobility, and stability characteristics of a mate- rial, account for these variations in charge ﬂow. In general, however, conductors are those materials that permit a generous ﬂow of electrons with very little external force (voltage) applied. In addition, good conductors typically have only one electron in the valence (most distant from the nucleus) ring. Since copper is used most frequently, it serves as the standard of comparison for the relative conductivity in Table 2.1. Note that alu- minum, which has seen some commercial use, has only 61% of the con- ductivity level of copper, but keep in mind that this must be weighed against the cost and weight factors. Insulators are those materials that have very few free electrons and require a large applied potential (voltage) to establish a measurable current level. 46  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V Voltage 12 V 0 Current 10 mA (a) I or t V or t0 (b) Increasing current or time Increasing voltage or time FIG. 2.23 Terminal characteristics: (a) ideal voltage source; (b) ideal current source. + – 15 V Jumper – (– 15 V) 15 V + 5 V – + (“Floating”) 5 V – + (c) (d) + – (a) Gnd (0 V) (b) – + Jumper 10 V – + (+ 10 V)10 V FIG. 2.22 dc laboratory supply: (a) available terminals; (b) positive voltage with respect to (w.r.t.) ground; (c) negative voltage w.r.t. ground; (d) ﬂoating supply. e I V A common use of insulating material is for covering current-carrying wire, which, if uninsulated, could cause dangerous side effects. Power- line repair people wear rubber gloves and stand on rubber mats as safety measures when working on high-voltage transmission lines. A number of different types of insulators and their applications appear in Fig. 2.24. CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS  47 e I V TABLE 2.1 Relative conductivity of various materials.

The breakdown strengths of some com- mon insulators are listed in Table 2.2.

The preﬁx semi, included in the terminology, has the dictionary deﬁ- nition of half, partial, or between, as deﬁned by its use. The entire elec- tronics industry is dependent on this class of materials since electronic devices and integrated circuits (ICs) are constructed of semiconductor materials. Although silicon (Si) is the most extensively employed mate- rial, germanium (Ge) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are also used in many important devices. Semiconductor materials typically have four electrons in the outermost valence ring. Semiconductors are further characterized as being photoconductive and having a negative temperature coefﬁcient. Photoconductivity is a phenomenon where the photons (small packages of energy) from inci- dent light can increase the carrier density in the material and thereby the charge ﬂow level. A negative temperature coefﬁcient reveals that the resistance (a characteristic to be described in detail in the next chapter) will decrease with an increase in temperature (opposite to that of most conductors). A great deal more will be said about semiconductors in the chapters to follow and in your basic electronics courses. 2.7 AMMETERS AND VOLTMETERS It is important to be able to measure the current and voltage levels of an operating electrical system to check its operation, isolate malfunctions, and investigate effects impossible to predict on paper. As the names imply, ammeters are used to measure current levels, and voltmeters, the potential difference between two points. If the current levels are usually of the order of milliamperes, the instrument will typically be referred to as a milliammeter, and if the current levels are in the microampere range, as a microammeter. Similar statements can be made for voltage levels. Throughout the industry, voltage levels are measured more frequently than current levels, primarily because measurement of the former does not require that the network connections be disturbed. The potential difference between two points can be measured by simply connecting the leads of the meter across the two points, as indi- cated in Fig. 2.25. An up-scale reading is obtained by placing the posi- tive lead of the meter to the point of higher potential of the network and the common or negative lead to the point of lower potential. The reverse connection will result in a negative reading or a below-zero indication. Ammeters are connected as shown in Fig. 2.26. Since ammeters mea- sure the rate of ﬂow of charge, the meter must be placed in the network such that the charge will ﬂow through the meter. The only way this can 48  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V I + – E DMM voltmeter mode FIG. 2.25 Voltmeter connection for an up-scale (\u0005) reading. + – + – E DMM ammeter mode I System FIG. 2.26 Ammeter connection for an up-scale (\u0005) reading. e I V be accomplished is to open the path in which the current is to be mea- sured and place the meter between the two resulting terminals. For the conﬁguration of Fig. 2.26, the voltage source lead (\u0005)must be discon- nected from the system and the ammeter inserted as shown. An up-scale reading will be obtained if the polarities on the terminals of the amme- ter are such that the current of the system enters the positive terminal. The introduction of any meter into an electrical/electronic system raises a concern about whether the meter will affect the behavior of the system. This question and others will be examined in Chapters 5 and 6 after additional terms and concepts have been introduced. For the moment, let it be said that since voltmeters and ammeters do not have internal sources, they will affect the network when introduced for mea- surement purposes. The design of each, however, is such that the impact is minimized. There are instruments designed to measure just current or just volt- age levels. However, the most common laboratory meters include the volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) and the digital multimeter (DMM) of Figs. 2.27 and 2.28, respectively. Both instruments will measure voltage and current and a third quantity, resistance, to be introduced in the next chapter. The VOM uses an analog scale, which requires interpreting the position of a pointer on a continuous scale, while the DMM provides a display of numbers with decimal point accuracy determined by the cho- sen scale. Comments on the characteristics and use of various meters will be made throughout the text. However, the major study of meters will be left for the laboratory sessions.

Inc.) 2.8 APPLICATIONS Throughout the text, Applications sections such as this one have been included to permit a further investigation of terms, quantities, or sys- tems introduced in the chapter. The primary purpose of these Applica- tions is to establish a link between the theoretical concepts of the text and the real, practical world. Although the majority of components that appear in a system may not have been introduced (and, in fact, some components will not be examined until more advanced studies), the top- ics were chosen very carefully and should be quite interesting to a new student of the subject matter. Sufﬁcient comment is included to provide a surface understanding of the role of each part of the system, with the understanding that the details will come at a later date. Since exercises on the subject matter of the Applications do not appear at the end of the chapter, the content is designed not to challenge the student but rather to stimulate his or her interest and answer some basic questions such as how the system looks inside, what role speciﬁc elements play in the system, and, of course, how the system works. In essence, therefore, each Applications section provides an opportunity to begin to establish a practical background beyond simply the content of the chapter. Do not be concerned if you do not understand every detail of each applica- tion. Understanding will come with time and experience. For now, take what you can from the examples and then proceed with the material. Flashlight Although the ﬂashlight employs one of the simplest of electrical cir- cuits, a few fundamentals about its operation do carry over to more sophisticated systems. First, and quite obviously, it is a dc system with a lifetime totally dependent on the state of the batteries and bulb. Unless it is the rechargeable type, each time you use it, you take some of the life out of it. For many hours the brightness will not diminish notice- ably. Then, however, as it reaches the end of its ampere-hour capacity, the light will become dimmer at an increasingly rapid rate (almost exponentially). For the standard two-battery ﬂashlight appearing in Fig. 2.29(a) with its electrical schematic in Fig. 2.29(b), each 1.5-V battery has an ampere-hour rating of about 16 as supported by Fig. 2.12. The single-contact miniature ﬂange-base bulb is rated at 2.5 V and 300 mA with good brightness and a lifetime of about 30 hours. Thirty hours may not seem like a long lifetime, but you have to consider how long you usually use a ﬂashlight on each occasion. If we assume a 300-mA drain from the battery for the bulb when in use, the lifetime of the battery, by Eq. (2.9), is about 53 hours. Comparing the 53-hour lifetime of the bat- tery to the 30-hour life expectancy of the bulb suggests that we nor- mally have to replace bulbs more frequently than batteries. However, most of us have experienced the opposite effect: We can change batteries two or three times before we need to replace the bulb. This is simply one example of the fact that one cannot be guided solely by the speciﬁcations of each component of an electrical design. The operating conditions, terminal characteristics, and details about the actual response of the system for short and long periods of time must be taken into account. As mentioned earlier, the battery loses some of its power each time it is used. Although the terminal voltage may not change much at ﬁrst, its ability to provide the same level of current will 50  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V e I V drop with each usage. Further, batteries will slowly discharge due to “leakage currents” even if the switch is not on. The air surrounding the battery is “not clean” in the sense that moisture and other elements in the air can provide a conduction path for leakage currents through the air, through the surface of the battery itself, or through other nearby sur- faces, and the battery will eventually discharge. How often have we left a ﬂashlight with new batteries in a car for a long period of time only to ﬁnd the light very dim or the batteries dead when we need the ﬂashlight the most? An additional problem is acid leaks that appear as brown stains or corrosion on the casing of the battery. These leaks will also affect the life of the battery. Further, when the ﬂashlight is turned on, there is an initial surge in current that will drain the battery more than continuous use for a period of time. In other words, continually turning the ﬂashlight on and off will have a very detrimental effect on its life. We must also realize that the 30-hour rating of the bulb is for continu- ous use, that is, 300 mA ﬂowing through the bulb for a continuous 30 hours. Certainly, the ﬁlament in the bulb and the bulb itself will get hot- ter with time, and this heat has a detrimental effect on the ﬁlament wire. When the ﬂashlight is turned on and off, it gives the bulb a chance to cool down and regain its normal characteristics, thereby avoiding any real damage. Therefore, with normal use we can expect the bulb to last longer than the 30 hours speciﬁed for continuous use. Even though the bulb is rated for 2.5-V operation, it would appear that the two batteries would result in an applied voltage of 3 V which suggests poor operating conditions. However, a bulb rated at 2.5 V can easily handle 2.5 V to 3 V. In addition, as was pointed out in this chap- ter, the terminal voltage will drop with the current demand and usage. Under normal operating conditions, a 1.5-V battery is considered to be in good condition if the loaded terminal voltage is 1.3 V to 1.5 V. When it drops to 1 V to 1.1 V, it is weak, and when it drops to 0.8 V to 0.9 V, it has lost its effectiveness. The levels can be related directly to the test band now appearing on Duracell® batteries, such as on the one shown APPLICATIONS  51 e I V FIG. 2.29 (a) Eveready ® D cell ﬂashlight; (b) electrical schematic of ﬂashlight of part (a); (c) Duracell ® Powercheck™ D cell battery.

In the test band on this battery, the upper voltage area (green on the actual battery) is near 1.5 V (labeled 100%); the lighter area to the right, from about 1.3 V down to 1 V; and the replace area (red) on the far right, below 1 V. Be aware that the total supplied voltage of 3 V will be obtained only if the batteries are connected as shown in Fig. 2.29(b). Acciden- tally placing the two positive terminals together will result in a total voltage of 0 V, and the bulb will not light at all. Forthe vast majority of systems with more than one battery, the positive terminal of one battery will always be connected to the negative terminal of another. For all low-voltage batteries, the end with the nipple is the positive terminal, and the end with the ﬂat end is the negative terminal. In addition, the ﬂat or negative end of a battery is always connected to the battery casing with the helical coil to keep the batteries in place. The positive end of the battery is always connected to a ﬂat spring connection or the element to be operated. If you look carefully at the bulb, you will ﬁnd that the nipple connected to the positive end of the battery is insulated from the jacket around the base of the bulb. The jacket is the second terminal of the battery used to complete the cir- cuit through the on/off switch. If a ﬂashlight fails to operate properly, the ﬁrst thing to check is the state of the batteries. It is best to replace both batteries at once. A sys- tem with one good battery and one nearing the end of its life will result in pressure on the good battery to supply the current demand, and, in fact, the bad battery will actually be a drain on the good battery. Next check the condition of the bulb by checking the ﬁlament to see whether it has opened at some point because a long-term, continuous current level occurred or because the ﬂashlight was dropped. If the battery and bulb seem to be in good shape, the next area of concern is the contacts between the positive terminal and the bulb and the switch. Cleaning both with emery cloth will often eliminate this problem. 12-V Car Battery Charger Battery chargers are a common household piece of equpiment used to charge everything from small ﬂashlight batteries to heavy-duty, marine, lead-acid batteries. Since all are plugged into a 120-V ac outlet such as found in the home, the basic construction of each is quite similar. In every charging system a transformer (Chapter 21) must be included to cut the ac voltage to a level appropriate for the dc level to be estab- lished. A diode (also called rectiﬁer) arrangement must be included to convert the ac voltage which varies with time to a ﬁxed dc level such as described in this chapter. Diodes and/or rectiﬁers will be discussed in detail in your ﬁrst electronics course. Some dc chargers will also include a regulator to provide an improved dc level (one that varies less with time or load). Since the car battery charger is one of the most com- mon, it will be described in the next few paragraphs. The outside appearance and the internal construction of a Sears 6/2 AMP Manual Battery Charger are provided in Fig. 2.30. Note in Fig. 2.30(b) that the transformer (as in most chargers) takes up most of the internal space. The additional air space and the holes in the casing are there to ensure an outlet for the heat that will develop due to the result- ing current levels. 52  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V e I V The schematic of Fig. 2.31 includes all the basic components of the charger. Note ﬁrst that the 120 V from the outlet are applied directly across the primary of the transformer. The charging rate of 6 A or 2 A is determined by the switch, which simply controls how many windings of the primary will be in the circuit for the chosen charging rate. If the battery is charging at the 2-A level, the full primary will be in the cir- cuit, and the ratio of the turns in the primary to the turns in the sec- APPLICATIONS  53 e I V FIG. 2.30 Battery charger: (a) external appearance; (b) internal construction. (a) (b) Control switch Grounded to chassis Circuit breaker Meter leads Heat sink Rectifier (diode) configuration Transformer ondary will be a maximum. If it is charging at the 6-A level, fewer turns of the primary are in the circuit, and the ratio drops. When you study transformers, you will ﬁnd that the voltage at the primary and sec- ondary is directly related to the turns ratio. If the ratio from primary to secondary drops, then the voltage drops also. The reverse effect occurs if the turns on the secondary exceed those on the primary. The general appearance of the waveforms appears in Fig. 2.31 for the 6-A charging level. Note that so far, the ac voltage has the same wave shape across the primary and secondary. The only difference is in the peak value of the waveforms. Now the diodes take over and convert the ac waveform which has zero average value (the waveform above equals the waveform below) to one that has an average value (all above the axis) as shown in the same ﬁgure. For the moment simply recognize that diodes are semiconductor electronic devices that permit only con- ventional current to ﬂow through them in the direction indicated by the arrow in the symbol. Even though the waveform resulting from the diode action has a pulsing appearance with a peak value of about 18 V, it will charge the 12-V battery whenever its voltage is greater than that of the battery, as shown by the shaded area. Below the 12-V level the battery cannot discharge back into the charging network because the diodes permit current ﬂow in only one direction. In particular, note in Fig. 2.30(b) the large plate that carries the cur- rent from the rectiﬁer (diode) conﬁguration to the positive terminal of the battery. Its primary purpose is to provide a heat sink (a place for the heat to be distributed to the surrounding air) for the diode conﬁguration. Otherwise the diodes would eventually melt down and self-destruct due to the resulting current levels. Each component of Fig 2.31 has been carefully labeled in Fig. 2.30(b) for reference. When current is ﬁrst applied to a battery at the 6-A charge rate, the current demand as indicated by the meter on the face of the instrument may rise to 7 A or almost 8 A. However, the level of current will decrease as the battery charges until it drops to a level of 2 A or 3 A. For units such as this that do not have an automatic shutoff, it is impor- 54  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE e I V FIG. 2.31 Electrical schematic for the battery charger of Fig. 2.30. 120 V ac 2 A 6 A Transformer (step-down) 13 V + Diodes (rectifiers) Circuit breaker Current meter Negative clamp of charger Positive clamp of charger Peak = 18 V 12 V – e I V tant to disconnect the charger when the current drops to the fully charged level; otherwise, the battery will become overcharged and may be damaged. A battery that is at its 50% level can take as long as 10 hours to charge, so don’t expect it to be a 10-minute operation. In addi- tion, if a battery is in very bad shape with a lower than normal voltage, the initial charging current may be too high for the design. To protect against such situations, the circuit breaker will open and stop the charg- ing process. Because of the high current levels, it is important that the directions provided with the charger be carefully read and applied. Answering Machines/Phones dc Supply A wide variety of systems in the home and ofﬁce receive their dc operating voltage from an ac/dc conversion system plugged right into a 120-V ac outlet. Lap-top computers, answering machines/phones, radios, clocks, cellular phones, CD players, and so on, all receive their dc power from a packaged system such as appearing in Fig. 2.32. The conversion from ac to dc occurs within the unit which is plugged directly into the outlet. The dc voltage is available at the end of the long wire which is designed to be plugged into the operating unt. As small as the unit may be, it contains basically the same components as appear- ing in the battery charger of Fig. 2.30. APPLICATIONS  55 e I V FIG. 2.33 Internal construction of the 9-V dc supply of Fig. 2.32. FIG. 2.32 Answering machine/phone 9-V dc supply. Transformer Capacitor Diodes (2) 120-V ac plug 9-V dc output In Fig. 2.33 you can see the transformer used to cut the voltage down to appropriate levels (again the largest component of the system). Note that two diodes establish a dc level, and a capacitive ﬁlter (Chapter 10) is added to smooth out the dc as shown. The system can be relatively small because the operating current levels are quite small, permitting the use of thin wires to construct the transformer and limit its size. The lower cur- rents also reduce the concerns about heating effects, permitting a small housing structure. The unit of Fig. 2.33, rated at 9 V at 200 mA, is com- monly used to provide power to answering machines/phones. Further smoothing of the dc voltage will be accomplished by a regulator built into the receiving unit. The regulator is normally a small IC chip placed in the receiving unit to separate the heat that it generates from the heat generated by the transformer, thereby reducing the net heat at the outlet close to the wall. In addition, its placement in the receiving unit will reduce the possibility of picking up noise and oscillations along the long wire from the conversion unit to the operating unit, and it will ensure that the full rated voltage is available at the unit itself, not a lesser value due to losses along the line. e I V56  CURRENT AND VOLTAGE 9.

This opposition, due to the collisions between electrons and between electrons and other atoms in the material, which converts electrical energy into another form of energy such as heat, is called the resistance of the material. The unit of measurement of resistance is the ohm, for which the symbol is \u0001, the capital Greek letter omega. The circuit symbol for resistance appears in Fig. 3.1 with the graphic abbreviation for resistance (R). 3 Resistance R G FIG. 3.1 Resistance symbol and notation. R The resistance of any material with a uniform cross-sectional area is determined by the following four factors: 1. Material 2. Length 3. Cross-sectional area 4. Temperature The chosen material, with its unique molecular structure, will react dif- ferentially to pressures to establish current through its core. Conductors that permit a generous ﬂow of charge with little external pressure will have low resistance levels, while insulators will have high resistance characteristics. As one might expect, the longer the path the charge must pass through, the higher the resistance level, whereas the larger the area (and therefore available room), the lower the resistance. Resistance is thus directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to area. R G As the temperature of most conductors increases, the increased motion of the particles within the molecular structure makes it increas- ingly difﬁcult for the “free” carriers to pass through, and the resistance level increases. At a ﬁxed temperature of 20°C (room temperature), the resistance is related to the other three factors by (ohms, \u0001) (3.1) where r (Greek letter rho) is a characteristic of the material called the resistivity, l is the length of the sample, and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. The units of measurement substituted into Eq. (3.1) are related to the application. For circular wires, units of measurement are usually deﬁned as in Section 3.2. For most other applications involving important areas such as integrated circuits, the units are as deﬁned in Section 3.4. 3.2 RESISTANCE: CIRCULAR WIRES For a circular wire, the quantities appearing in Eq. (3.1) are deﬁned by Fig. 3.2. For two wires of the same physical size at the same tempera- ture, as shown in Fig. 3.3(a), the higher the resistivity, the more the resistance. As indicated in Fig. 3.3(b), the longer the length of a conductor, the more the resistance. Figure 3.3(c) reveals for remaining similar determining variables that the smaller the area of a conductor, the more the resistance. Finally, Figure 3.3(d) states that for metallic wires of identical con- struction and material, the higher the temperature of a conductor, the more the resistance. For circular wires, the quantities of Eq. (3.1) have the following units: r: CM-ohms/ft at T \u0002 20°C l: feet A: circular mils (CM) R \u0002 r \u0003 A l \u0003 60  RESISTANCE l T (°C) A FIG. 3.2 Factors affecting the resistance of a conductor.

For each case, all remaining parameters that control the resistance level are the same. R G Note that the area of the conductor is measured in circular mils (CM) and not in square meters, inches, and so on, as determined by the equation r \u0002 radius d \u0002 diameter (3.2) The mil is a unit of measurement for length and is related to the inch by 1 mil \u0001 in. or 1000 mils \u0001 1 in. By deﬁnition, a wire with a diameter of 1 mil has an area of 1 circular mil (CM), as shown in Fig. 3.4. One square mil was superimposed on the 1-CM area of Fig. 3.4 to clearly show that the square mil has a larger surface area than the cir- cular mil. Applying the above deﬁnition to a wire having a diameter of 1 mil, and applying Eq. (3.2), we have Therefore, 1 CM \u0001 sq mils (3.3a) or 1 sq mil \u0001 CM (3.3b) Dividing Eq. (3.3b) through will result in 1 sq mil \u0002 CM \u0002 1.273 CM which certainly agrees with the pictorial representation of Fig. 3.4. For a wire with a diameter of N mils (where N can be any positive number), A \u0002\u0002 sq mils Substituting the fact that 4/p CM \u0002 1 sq mil, we have A \u0002 (sq mils) \u0002 \u0001\u0002\u0001 CM\u0002 \u0002 N 2 CM Since d \u0002 N, the area in circular mils is simply equal to the diame- ter in mils square; that is, (3.4) Veriﬁcation that an area can simply be the diameter squared is provided in part by Fig. 3.5 for diameters of 2 and 3 mils. Although some areas are not circular, they have the same area as 1 circular mil.

Since 1 mil \u0002 0.001 in., if the diameter is given in inches, simply move the decimal point three places to the right.

Its value is the resistance of a length of wire 1 ft by 1 mil in diameter, measured at 20°C (Fig. 3.6). The unit of measurement for r can be determined from Eq. (3.1) by ﬁrst solving for r and then substituting the units of the other quantities. That is, r \u0002 and Units of r \u0002 \u0003 CM ft • \u0002\u0003 The resistivity r is also measured in ohms per mil-foot, as deter- mined by Fig. 3.6, or ohm-meters in the SI system of units.

Similarly, since resistivity is a major factor in determining the resistance of a conductor, the lower the resistivity, the lower the resis- tance for the same size conductor. Table 3.1 would suggest therefore that silver, copper, gold, and aluminum would be the best conductors and the most common. In general, there are other factors, however, such as malleability (ability of a material to be shaped), ductility (ability of a material to be drawn into long, thin wires), temperature sensitivity, resistance to abuse, and, of course, cost, that must all be weighed when choosing a conductor for a particular application. In general, copper is the most widely used material because it is quite malleable, ductile, and available; has good thermal characteristics; and is less expensive than silver or gold. It is certainly not cheap, how- ever. Wiring is removed quickly from buildings to be torn down, for example, to extract the copper. At one time aluminum was introduced for general wiring because it is cheaper than copper, but its thermal characteristics created some difﬁculties. It was found that the heating due to current ﬂow and the cooling that occurred when the circuit was turned off resulted in expansion and contraction of the aluminum wire to the point where connections could eventually work themselves loose and dangerous side effects could result. Aluminum is still used today, however, in areas such as integrated circuit manufacturing and in situa- tions where the connections can be made secure. Silver and gold are, of course, much more expensive than copper or aluminum, but there are places where the cost is justiﬁed. Silver has excellent plating character- istics for surface preparations, and gold is used quite extensively in integrated circuits. Tungsten has a resistivity three times that of copper, but there are occasions when its physical characteristics (durability, hardness) are the overriding considerations. 3.3 WIRE TABLES The wire table was designed primarily to standardize the size of wire produced by manufacturers throughout the United States.

The table was designed to assist the user in every way possible; it usually includes data such as the cross-sectional area in circular mils, diameter in mils, ohms per 1000 feet at 20°C, and weight per 1000 feet. The American Wire Gage (AWG) sizes are given in Table 3.2 for solid round copper wire. A column indicating the maximum allowable current in amperes, as determined by the National Fire Protection Asso- ciation, has also been included. The chosen sizes have an interesting relationship: For every drop in 3 gage numbers, the area is doubled; and for every drop in 10 gage numbers, the area increases by a factor of 10. Examining Eq. (3.1), we note also that doubling the area cuts the resistance in half, and increasing the area by a factor of 10 decreases the resistance of 1/10 the original, everything else kept constant. The actual sizes of the gage wires listed in Table 3.2 are shown in Fig. 3.9 with a few of their areas of application. A few examples using Table 3.2 follow. EXAMPLE 3.4 Find the resistance of 650 ft of #8 copper wire (T \u0002 20°C).

(or close to 1/12 in.) EXAMPLE 3.6 For the system of Fig. 3.10, the total resistance of each power line cannot exceed 0.025 \u0001, and the maximum current to be drawn by the load is 95 A. What gage wire should be used? Solution: R \u0002 r ⇒ A \u0002 r \u0002\u0002 41,480 CM Using the wire table, we choose the wire with the next largest area, which is #4, to satisfy the resistance requirement. We note, however, that 95 A must ﬂow through the line. This speciﬁcation requires that #3 wire be used since the #4 wire can carry a maximum current of only 85 A. 3.4 RESISTANCE: METRIC UNITS The design of resistive elements for various areas of application, including thin-ﬁlm resistors and integrated circuits, uses metric units for the quantities of Eq. (3.1). In SI units, the resistivity would be mea- sured in ohm-meters, the area in square meters, and the length in (10.37 CM⋅\u0001/ft)(100 ft)\u0003\u0003\u0003 0.025 \u0001 l \u0003 R l \u0003 A 0.6282 \u0001\u0003\u0003 1000 ft D = 0.365 in. ≅ 1/3 in. 00 Power distribution Stranded for increased flexibility D = 0.081 in. ≅ 1/12 in.

R G The conversion factor between resistivity in circular mil-ohms per foot and ohm-centimeters is the following: For example, for copper, r \u0002 10.37 CM⋅\u0001/ft: r (\u0001⋅cm) \u0002 1.662 \u0004 10 \u00057(10.37 CM⋅\u0001/ft) \u0002 1.723 \u0004 10 \u00056 \u0001⋅cm as indicated in Table 3.3. The resistivity in IC design is typically in ohm-centimeter units, although tables often provide r in ohm-meters or microhm-centimeters. Using the conversion technique of Chapter 1, we ﬁnd that the conver- sion factor between ohm-centimeters and ohm-meters is the following: 1.723 \u0004 10 \u00056 \u0001⋅cm\u0007\b \u0002 [1.723 \u0004 10 \u00056] \u0001⋅m or the value in ohm-meters is 1/100 the value in ohm-centimeters, and Similarly: For comparison purposes, typical values of r in ohm-centimeters for conductors, semiconductors, and insulators are provided in Table 3.4. r (m\u0001⋅cm) \u0002 (10 6) \u0004 (value in \u0001⋅cm) r (\u0001⋅m) \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 11 00 \u0003\u0002 \u0004 (value in \u0001⋅cm) 1\u0003 100 1 m\u0003 100 cm r (\u0001⋅cm) \u0002 (1.662 \u0004 10 \u00057) \u0004 (value in CM ⋅\u0001/ft) TEMPERATURE EFFECTS  67 TABLE 3.4 Comparing levels of r in \u0001⋅cm.

There is a sig- niﬁcant difference in levels of r for the list of semiconductors, but the power-of-ten difference between the conductor and insulator levels is at least 10 6 for each of the semiconductors listed. 3.5 TEMPERATURE EFFECTS Temperature has a signiﬁcant effect on the resistance of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Conductors Conductors have a generous number of free electrons, and any intro- duction of thermal energy will have little impact on the total number of R G free carriers. In fact, the thermal energy will only increase the intensity of the random motion of the particles within the material and make it increasingly difﬁcult for a general drift of electrons in any one direction to be established. The result is that for good conductors, an increase in temperature will result in an increase in the resistance level. Consequently, conductors have a positive temperature coefﬁcient. The plot of Fig. 3.13(a) has a positive temperature coefﬁcient. 68  RESISTANCE Semiconductors In semiconductors an increase in temperature will impart a measure of thermal energy to the system that will result in an increase in the num- ber of free carriers in the material for conduction. The result is that for semiconductor materials, an increase in temperature will result in a decrease in the resistance level. Consequently, semiconductors have negative temperature coefﬁcients. The thermistor and photoconductive cell of Sections 3.10 and 3.11 of this chapter are excellent examples of semiconductor devices with negative temperature coefﬁcients. The plot of Fig. 3.13(b) has a nega- tive temperature coefﬁcient. Insulators As with semiconductors, an increase in temperature will result in a decrease in the resistance of an insulator. The result is a negative temperature coefﬁcient. Inferred Absolute Temperature Figure 3.14 reveals that for copper (and most other metallic conduc- tors), the resistance increases almost linearly (in a straight-line relation- ship) with an increase in temperature. Since temperature can have such a pronounced effect on the resistance of a conductor, it is important that we have some method of determining the resistance at any temperature within operating limits. An equation for this purpose can be obtained by approximating the curve of Fig. 3.14 by the straight dashed line that intersects the temperature scale at \u0005234.5°C. Although the actual curve extends to absolute zero (\u0005273.15°C, or 0 K), the straight-line approx- imation is quite accurate for the normal operating temperature range. At two different temperatures, T1 and T2, the resistance of copper is R1 and R2, as indicated on the curve. Using a property of similar triangles, we may develop a mathematical relationship between these values of resis- FIG. 3.13 (a) Positive temperature coefﬁcient—conductors; (b) negative temperature coefﬁcient—semiconductors. (a) Temperature R 0 + Temperature coefficient (b) Temperature R 0 – Temperature coefficient R G tances at different temperatures. Let x equal the distance from \u0005234.5°C to T1 and y the distance from \u0005234.5°C to T2, as shown in Fig. 3.14. From similar triangles, \u0002 or (3.5) The temperature of \u0005234.5°C is called the inferred absolute temper- ature of copper. For different conducting materials, the intersection of the straight-line approximation will occur at different temperatures. A few typical values are listed in Table 3.5. The minus sign does not appear with the inferred absolute tempera- ture on either side of Eq. (3.5) because x and y are the distances from \u0005234.5°C to T1 and T2, respectively, and therefore are simply magni- tudes. For T1 and T2 less than zero, x and y are less than \u0005234.5°C, and the distances are the differences between the inferred absolute temper- ature and the temperature of interest. Equation (3.5) can easily be adapted to any material by inserting the proper inferred absolute temperature. It may therefore be written as follows: (3.6) where |T 1| indicates that the inferred absolute temperature of the mate- rial involved is inserted as a positive value in the equation. In general, therefore, associate the sign only with T1 and T2. EXAMPLE 3.9 If the resistance of a copper wire is 50 \u0001 at 20°C, what is its resistance at 100°C (boiling point of water)?

Deﬁning (\u0001/°C/\u0001) (3.7) as the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance at a temperature of 20°C, and R20 as the resistance of the sample at 20°C, the resistance R1 at a temperature T1 is determined by (3.8) The values of a 20 for different materials have been evaluated, and a few are listed in Table 3.6. Equation (3.8) can be written in the following form: a20 \u0002\u0002 from which the units of \u0001/°C/\u0001 for a20 are deﬁned. Since DR/DT is the slope of the curve of Fig. 3.14, we can conclude that the higher the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance for a material, the more sensitive the resistance level to changes in temperature. Referring to Table 3.5, we ﬁnd that copper is more sensitive to tem- perature variations than is silver, gold, or aluminum, although the dif- ferences are quite small. The slope deﬁned by a20 for constantan is so small that the curve is almost horizontal. — D D R T — — R20 \u0001\u0003 T R 1 1 \u0005 \u0005 2 R 0° 20 C\u0003 \u0002 —–– R20 R1 \u0002 R20[1 \u0006 a 20(T1 \u0005 20°C)] a 20 \u0002 \u0003 |T1| \u0006 120°C\u0003 256°C\u0003 100 m\u0001 236°C \u0006 T2\u0003\u0003 120 m\u0001 236°C \u0006 20°C\u0003\u0003 100 m\u0001 (30 \u0001)(194.5°C)\u0003\u0003 234.5°C 234.5°C \u0005 40°C\u0003\u0003 R2 234.5°C \u0006 0\u0003\u0003 30 \u0001 70  RESISTANCE TABLE 3.6 Temperature coefﬁcient of resistance for various conductors at 20°C.

PPM/°C For resistors, as for conductors, resistance changes with a change in temperature. The speciﬁcation is normally provided in parts per million per degree Celsius (PPM/°C), providing an immediate indication of the sensitivity level of the resistor to temperature. For resistors, a 5000-PPM level is considered high, whereas 20 PPM is quite low. A 1000-PPM/°C characteristic reveals that a 1° change in temperature will result in a change in resistance equal to 1000 PPM, or 1000/1,000,000 \u0002 1/1000 of its nameplate value—not a signiﬁcant change for most applications. However, a 10° change would result in a change equal to 1/100 (1%) of its nameplate value, which is becoming signiﬁcant. The concern, there- fore, lies not only with the PPM level but with the range of expected temperature variation. In equation form, the change in resistance is given by (3.10) where Rnominal is the nameplate value of the resistor at room tempera- ture and DT is the change in temperature from the reference level of 20°C.

Even though new developments appear almost weekly from extensive research and development activities, every once in a while there is some very special step forward that has the whole ﬁeld at the edge of its seat waiting to see what might develop in the near future. Such a level of excitement and interest surrounds the research 1000 \u0001\u0003 106 DR \u0002 \u0003 Rn 1 o 0 m 6 inal\u0003 (PPM)(DT ) R \u0002 r\u0003 A l \u0003[1 \u0006 a20 DT ] SUPERCONDUCTORS  71 R G drive to develop a room-temperature superconductor—an advance that will rival the introduction of semiconductor devices such as the transis- tor (to replace tubes), wireless communication, or the electric light. The implications of such a development are so far-reaching that it is difﬁcult to forecast the vast impact it will have on the entire ﬁeld. The intensity of the research effort throughout the world today to develop a room-temperature superconductor is described by some researchers as “unbelievable, contagious, exciting, and demanding” but an adventure in which they treasure the opportunity to be involved. Progress in the ﬁeld since 1986 suggests that the use of superconductiv- ity in commercial applications will grow quite rapidly in the next few decades. It is indeed an exciting era full of growing anticipation! Why this interest in superconductors? What are they all about? In a nutshell, superconductors are conductors of electric charge that, for all practical purposes, have zero resistance. In a conventional conductor, electrons travel at average speeds in the neighborhood of 1000 mi/s (they can cross the United States in about 3 seconds), even though Einstein’s theory of relativity suggests that the maximum speed of information transmission is the speed of light, or 186,000 mi/s. The relatively slow speed of conventional conduction is due to collisions with other atoms in the material, repulsive forces between electrons (like charges repel), thermal agitation that results in indirect paths due to the increased motion of the neighboring atoms, impurities in the conductor, and so on. In the superconductive state, there is a pairing of electrons, denoted by the Cooper effect, in which electrons travel in pairs and help each other maintain a signiﬁcantly higher velocity through the medium. In some ways this is like “draft- ing” by competitive cyclists or runners. There is an oscillation of energy between partners or even “new” partners (as the need arises) to ensure passage through the conductor at the highest possible velocity with the least total expenditure of energy. Even though the concept of superconductivity ﬁrst surfaced in 1911, it was not until 1986 that the possibility of superconductivity at room temperature became a renewed goal of the research community. For some 74 years superconductivity could be established only at temper- atures colder than 23 K. (Kelvin temperature is universally accepted as the unit of measurement for temperature for superconductive effects. Recall that K \u0002 273.15° \u0006 °C, so a temperature of 23 K is \u0005250°C, or \u0005418°F.) In 1986, however, physicists Alex Muller and George Bednorz of the IBM Zurich Research Center found a ceramic mate- rial, lanthanum barium copper oxide, that exhibited superconductivity at 30 K. Although it would not appear to be a significant step for- ward, it introduced a new direction to the research effort and spurred others to improve on the new standard. In October 1987 both scientists received the Nobel prize for their contribution to an important area of development. In just a few short months, Professors Paul Chu of the University of Houston and Man Kven Wu of the University of Alabama raised the temperature to 95 K using a superconductor of yttrium barium copper oxide. The result was a level of excitement in the scientiﬁc community that brought research in the area to a new level of effort and investment. The major impact of such a discovery was that liquid nitrogen (boiling point of 77 K) could now be used to bring the material down to the required temperature rather than liquid helium, which boils at 4 K. The 72  RESISTANCE R G result is a tremendous saving in the cooling expense since liquid helium is at least ten times more expensive than liquid nitrogen. Pursuing the same direction, some success has been achieved at 125 K and 162 K using a thallium compound (unfortunately, however, thallium is a very poisonous substance). Figure 3.15 clearly reveals that there was little change in the temper- ature for superconductors until the discovery of 1986. The curve then takes a sharp curve upward, suggesting that room-temperature supercon- ductors may become available in a few short years. However, unless there is a signiﬁcant breakthrough in the near future, this goal no longer seems feasible. The effort continues and is receiving an increasing level of ﬁnancing and worldwide attention. Now, increasing numbers of cor- porations are trying to capitalize on the success already attained, as will be discussed later in this section. SUPERCONDUCTORS  73 The fact that ceramics have provided the recent breakthrough in superconductivity is probably a surprise when you consider that they are also an important class of insulators. However, the ceramics that exhibit the characteristics of superconductivity are compounds that include copper, oxygen, and rare earth elements such as yttrium, lan- thanum, and thallium. There are also indicators that the current com- pounds may be limited to a maximum temperature of 200 K (about 100 K short of room temperature), leaving the door wide open to inno- vative approaches to compound selection. The temperature at which a superconductor reverts back to the characteristics of a conventional conductor is called the critical temperature, denoted by Tc. Note in Fig. 3.16 that the resistivity level changes abruptly at Tc. The sharpness of the transition region is a function of the purity of the sample. Long list- ings of critical temperatures for a variety of tested compounds can be found in reference materials providing tables of a wide variety to sup- port research in physics, chemistry, geology, and related ﬁelds. Two such publications include the CRC (The Chemical Rubber Co.) Hand- book of Tables for Applied Engineering Science and the CRC Hand- book of Chemistry and Physics.

In the area of integrated circuit manufacturing, current den- sity levels must equal or exceed 1 MA/cm2, or 1 million amperes through a cross-sectional area about one-half the size of a dime. Recently IBM attained a level of 4 MA/cm2 at 77 K, permitting the use of superconductors in the design of some new-generation, high-speed computers. Although room-temperature success has not been attained, there are numerous applications for some of the superconductors developed thus far. It is simply a matter of balancing the additional cost against the results obtained or deciding whether any results at all can be obtained without the use of this zero-resistance state. Some research efforts require high-energy accelerators or strong magnets attainable only with superconductive materials. Superconductivity is currently applied in the design of 300-mi/h Meglev trains (trains that ride on a cushion of air established by opposite magnetic poles), in powerful motors and gener- ators, in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging systems to obtain cross- sectional images of the brain (and other parts of the body), in the design of computers with operating speeds four times that of conventional sys- tems, and in improved power distribution systems. The range of future uses for superconductors is a function of how much success physicists have in raising the operating temperature and how well they can utilize the successes obtained thus far. However, it would appear that it is only a matter of time (the eternal optimist) before magnetically levitated trains increase in number, improved med- ical diagnostic equipment is available, computers operate at much higher speeds, high-efﬁciency power and storage systems are available, and transmission systems operate at very high efﬁciency levels due to this area of developing interest. Only time will reveal the impact that this new direction will have on the quality of life. 3.7 TYPES OF RESISTORS Fixed Resistors Resistors are made in many forms, but all belong in either of two groups: ﬁxed or variable. The most common of the low-wattage, ﬁxed- FIG. 3.16 Deﬁning the critical temperature Tc. R G TYPES OF RESISTORS  75 type resistors is the molded carbon composition resistor. The basic con- struction is shown in Fig. 3.17. The relative sizes of all ﬁxed and variable resistors change with the wattage (power) rating, increasing in size for increased wattage ratings in order to withstand the higher currents and dissipation losses. The rel- ative sizes of the molded composition resistors for different wattage rat- ings are shown in Fig. 3.18. Resistors of this type are readily available in values ranging from 2.7 \u0001 to 22 M\u0001. The temperature-versus-resistance curves for a 10,000-\u0001 and 0.5- M\u0001 composition-type resistor are shown in Fig. 3.19. Note the small percent resistance change in the normal temperature operating range. Several other types of ﬁxed resistors using high-resistance wire or metal ﬁlms are shown in Fig. 3.20. The miniaturization of parts—used quite extensively in computers— requires that resistances of different values be placed in very small packages. Some examples appear in Fig. 3.21. For use with printed circuit boards, ﬁxed resistor networks in a vari- ety of conﬁgurations are available in miniature packages, such as those shown in Fig. 3.22. The ﬁgure includes a photograph of three different casings and the internal resistor conﬁguration for the single in-line structure to the right. Variable Resistors Variable resistors, as the name implies, have a terminal resistance that can be varied by turning a dial, knob, screw, or whatever seems appro- priate for the application. They can have two or three terminals, but most have three terminals. If the two- or three-terminal device is used as a variable resistor, it is usually referred to as a rheostat. If the three- terminal device is used for controlling potential levels, it is then com- monly called a potentiometer. Even though a three-terminal device can be used as a rheostat or potentiometer (depending on how it is con- nected), it is typically called a potentiometer when listed in trade mag- azines or requested for a particular application.

When used as a variable resistor (or rheostat), it can be hooked up in one of two ways, as shown in Fig. 3.23(b) and (c). In Fig. 3.23(b), points a and b are hooked up to the circuit, and the remaining terminal is left hanging. The resistance introduced is determined by that portion of the resistive element between points a and b. In Fig. 3.23(c), the resistance is again between points a and b, but now the remaining resistance is “shorted-out” (effect removed) by the connec- tion from b to c. The universally accepted symbol for a rheostat appears in Fig. 3.23(d). Most potentiometers have three terminals in the relative positions shown in Fig. 3.24. The knob, dial, or screw in the center of the hous- ing controls the motion of a contact that can move along the resistive element connected between the outer two terminals. The contact is con- nected to the center terminal, establishing a resistance from movable contact to each outer terminal. 76  RESISTANCE FIG. 3.20 Fixed resistors.

(Courtesy of Allen-Bradley Co.) R G TYPES OF RESISTORS  77 The resistance between the outside terminals a and c of Fig. 3.25(a) (and Fig. 3.24) is always ﬁxed at the full rated value of the potentiometer, regardless of the position of the wiper arm b. In other words, the resistance between terminals a and c of Fig. 3.25(a) for a 1-M\u0001 potentiometer will always be 1 M\u0001, no matter how we turn the control element and move the contact. In Fig. 3.25(a) the center contact is not part of the network conﬁguration. The resistance between the wiper arm and either outside terminal can be varied from a minimum of 0 \u0001 to a maximum value equal to the full rated value of the potentiometer. In Fig. 3.25(b) the wiper arm has been placed 1/4 of the way down from point a to point c. The resulting resistance between points a and b will therefore be 1/4 of the total, or 250 k\u0001 (for a 1-M\u0001 poten- tiometer), and the resistance between b and c will be 3/4 of the total, or 750 k\u0001. The sum of the resistances between the wiper arm and each outside terminal will equal the full rated resistance of the potentiometer. This was demonstrated by Fig. 3.25(b), where 250 k\u0001\u0006 750 k\u0001\u0002 1 M\u0001.

For example, if Rab of a 1-k\u0001 potentiometer is 200 \u0001, then the resistance Rbc must be 800 \u0001. If Rab is further decreased to 50 \u0001, then Rbc must increase to 950 \u0001, and so on. The molded carbon composition potentiometer is typically applied in networks with smaller power demands, and it ranges in size from 20 \u0001 to 22 M\u0001 (maximum values). Other commercially available potentiometers appear in Fig. 3.26. a R + – – + Vab b c Vbc FIG. 3.27 Potentiometer control of voltage levels. When the device is used as a potentiometer, the connections are as shown in Fig. 3.27. It can be used to control the level of Vab, Vbc,or both, depending on the application. Additional discussion of the potentiometer in a loaded situation can be found in the chapters that follow. 3.8 COLOR CODING AND STANDARD RESISTOR VALUES A wide variety of resistors, ﬁxed or variable, are large enough to have their resistance in ohms printed on the casing. Some, however, are too small to have numbers printed on them, so a system of color coding is used. For the ﬁxed molded composition resistor, four or ﬁve color bands are printed on one end of the outer casing, as shown in Fig. 3.28. Each color has the numerical value indicated in Table 3.7. The color bands are always read from the end that has the band closest to it, as shown in Fig. 3.28. The ﬁrst and second bands represent the ﬁrst and second digits, respectively. The third band determines the power-of-ten multiplier for the ﬁrst two digits (actually the number of zeros that fol- low the second digit) or a multiplying factor if gold or silver. The fourth band is the manufacturer’s tolerance, which is an indication of the pre- cision by which the resistor was made. If the fourth band is omitted, the tolerance is assumed to be \u000720%. The ﬁfth band is a reliability factor, which gives the percentage of failure per 1000 hours of use. For instance, FIG. 3.26 Potentiometers: (a) 4-mm (\t5/32\u0001) trimmer (courtesy of Bourns, Inc.); (b) conductive plastic and cermet element (courtesy of Clarostat Mfg. Co.).

R G a 1% failure rate would reveal that one out of every 100 (or 10 out of every 1000) will fail to fall within the tolerance range after 1000 hours of use.

One might expect that resistors would be available for a full range of values such as 10 \u0001,20 \u0001,30 \u0001,40 \u0001,50 \u0001, and so on. However, this is not the case with some typical commercial values, such as 27 \u0001, 56 \u0001, and 68 \u0001. This may seem somewhat strange and out of place. There is a reason for the chosen values, which is best demonstrated by examining the list of standard values of commercially available resis- tors in Table 3.8. The values in boldface blue are available with 5%, 10%, and 20% tolerances, making them the most common of the com- mercial variety. The values in boldface black are typically available with 5% and 10% tolerances, and those in normal print are available only in the 5% variety. If we separate the values available into tolerance levels, we have Table 3.9, which clearly reveals how few are available up to 100 \u0001 with 20% tolerances. An examination of the impact of the tolerance level will now help explain the choice of numbers for the commercial values.

R G gaps. Dropping to the 10% level introduces the 56-\u0001 and 82-\u0001 resistors to ﬁll in the gaps, as shown in Fig. 3.29(b). Dropping to the 5% level would require additional resistor values to ﬁll in the gaps. In total, therefore, the resistor values were chosen to ensure that the full range was covered, as determined by the tolerances employed. Of course, if a speciﬁc value is desired but is not one of the standard values, combina- tions of standard values will often result in a total resistance very close to the desired level. If this approach is still not satisfactory, a poten- tiometer can be set to the exact value and then inserted in the network. Throughout the text you will ﬁnd that many of the resistor values are not standard values. This was done to reduce the mathematical complexity, which might deter from or cloud the procedure or analy- sis technique being introduced. In the problem sections, however, stan- dard values are frequently employed to ensure that the reader starts to become familiar with the commercial values available. 3.9 CONDUCTANCE By ﬁnding the reciprocal of the resistance of a material, we have a measure of how well the material will conduct electricity. The quantity is called conductance, has the symbol G, and is measured in siemens (S) (note Fig. 3.30). In equation form, conductance is (siemens, S) (3.12) A resistance of 1 M\u0001 is equivalent to a conductance of 10\u00056 S, and a resistance of 10 \u0001 is equivalent to a conductance of 10\u00051 S. The larger the conductance, therefore, the less the resistance and the greater the conductivity. In equation form, the conductance is determined by (S) (3.13) indicating that increasing the area or decreasing either the length or the resistivity will increase the conductance. EXAMPLE 3.14 What is the relative increase or decrease in conduc- tivity of a conductor if the area is reduced by 30% and the length is increased by 40%? The resistivity is ﬁxed. Solution: Eq.

Inspired by the electronic telegraph invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1817, he improved on the design and proceeded to lay cable with the help of his brother Carl across the Mediterranean and from Europe to India. His inventions included the ﬁrst self-excited generator, which depended on the resid- ual magnetism of its electronmagnet rather than an inefﬁcient permanent magnet. In 1888 he was raised to the rank of nobility with the addition of von to his name. The current ﬁrm of Siemens AG has manu- facturing outlets in some 35 countries with sales ofﬁces in some 125 countries. R G 3.10 OHMMETERS The ohmmeter is an instrument used to perform the following tasks and several other useful functions: 1. Measure the resistance of individual or combined elements 2. Detect open-circuit (high-resistance) and short-circuit (low-resis- tance) situations 3. Check continuity of network connections and identify wires of a multilead cable 4. Test some semiconductor (electronic) devices For most applications, the ohmmeters used most frequently are the ohmmeter section of a VOM or DMM. The details of the internal cir- cuitry and the method of using the meter will be left primarily for a laboratory exercise. In general, however, the resistance of a resistor can be measured by simply connecting the two leads of the meter across the resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.31. There is no need to be concerned about which lead goes on which end; the result will be the same in either case since resistors offer the same resistance to the ﬂow of charge (current) in either direction. If the VOM is employed, a switch must be set to the proper resistance range, and a nonlinear scale (usually the top scale of the meter) must be properly read to obtain the resistance value. The DMM also requires choosing the best scale setting for the resistance to be measured, but the result appears as a numerical display, with the proper placement of the dec- imal point as determined by the chosen scale. When measuring the resistance of a single resistor, it is usually best to remove the resis- tor from the network before making the measurement. If this is difﬁ- cult or impossible, at least one end of the resistor must not be con- nected to the network, or the reading may include the effects of the other elements of the system. If the two leads of the meter are touching in the ohmmeter mode, the resulting resistance is zero. A connection can be checked as shown in Fig. 3.32 by simply hooking up the meter to either side of the connec- tion. If the resistance is zero, the connection is secure. If it is other than zero, the connection could be weak, and, if it is inﬁnite, there is no con- nection at all. If one wire of a harness is known, a second can be found as shown in Fig. 3.33. Simply connect the end of the known lead to the end of any other lead. When the ohmmeter indicates zero ohms (or very low resistance), the second lead has been identiﬁed. The above procedure can also be used to determine the ﬁrst known lead by simply connect- ing the meter to any wire at one end and then touching all the leads at the other end until a zero-ohm indication is obtained. 82  RESISTANCE \u0001 FIG. 3.31 Measuring the resistance of a single element. \u0001 FIG. 3.32 Checking the continuity of a connection. \u0001 FIG. 3.33 Identifying the leads of a multilead cable. R G THERMISTORS  83 Preliminary measurements of the condition of some electronic devices such as the diode and transistor can be made using the ohmmeter. The meter can also be used to identify the terminals of such devices. One important note about the use of any ohmmeter: Never hook up an ohmmeter to a live circuit! The reading will be meaningless and you may damage the instrument. The ohmmeter section of any meter is designed to pass a small sensing current through the resistance to be measured. A large external current could damage the movement and would certainly throw off the calibra- tion of the instrument. In addition, never store a VOM or a DMM in the resistance mode. The two leads of the meter could touch and the small sensing current could drain the internal battery. VOMs should be stored with the selec- tor switch on the highest voltage range, and the selector switch of DMMs should be in the off position. 3.11 THERMISTORS The thermistor is a two-terminal semiconductor device whose resis- tance, as the name suggests, is temperature sensitive. A representative characteristic appears in Fig. 3.34 with the graphic symbol for the device. Note the nonlinearity of the curve and the drop in resistance from about 5000 \u0001 to 100 \u0001 for an increase in temperature from 20°C to 100°C. The decrease in resistance with an increase in temperature indicates a negative temperature coefﬁcient. The temperature of the device can be changed internally or exter- nally. An increase in current through the device will raise its tempera- ture, causing a drop in its terminal resistance. Any externally applied heat source will result in an increase in its body temperature and a drop in resistance. This type of action (internal or external) lends itself well to control mechanisms. Many different types of thermistors are shown in Fig. 3.35. Materials employed in the manufacture of thermistors include oxides of cobalt, nickel, strontium, and manganese.

The log scale permits the display of a wider range of speciﬁc resistance levels than a linear scale such as the horizontal axis. Note that it extends from 0.0001 \u0001·cmto 100,000,000 \u0001·cm over avery short interval. The log scale is used for both the vertical and the horizontal axis of Fig. 3.36. 3.12 PHOTOCONDUCTIVE CELL The photoconductive cell is a two-terminal semiconductor device whose terminal resistance is determined by the intensity of the incident light on its exposed surface. As the applied illumination increases in intensity, the energy state of the surface electrons and atoms increases, with a resultant increase in the number of “free carriers” and a corre- sponding drop in resistance. A typical set of characteristics and the photoconductive cell’s graphic symbol appear in Fig. 3.36. Note the negative illumination coefﬁcient. Several cadmium sulﬁde photocon- ductive cells appear in Fig. 3.37. 3.13 VARISTORS Varistors are voltage-dependent, nonlinear resistors used to suppress high-voltage transients; that is, their characteristics are such as to limit the voltage that can appear across the terminals of a sensitive device or system. A typical set of characteristics appears in Fig. 3.38(a), along with a linear resistance characteristic for comparison purposes. Note that at a particular “ﬁring voltage,” the current rises rapidly but the volt- age is limited to a level just above this ﬁring potential. In other words, the magnitude of the voltage that can appear across this device cannot exceed that level deﬁned by its characteristics. Through proper design techniques this device can therefore limit the voltage appearing across sensitive regions of a network. The current is simply limited by the net- work to which it is connected. A photograph of a number of commer- cial units appears in Fig. 3.38(b). FIG. 3.38 Varistors available with maximum dc voltage ratings between 18 V and 615 V. (Courtesy of Philips Components, Inc.) R G APPLICATIONS  85 3.14 APPLICATIONS The following are examples of how resistance can be used to perform a variety of tasks, from heating to measuring the stress or strain on a sup- porting member of a structure. In general, resistance is a component of every electrical or electronic application. Electric Baseboard Heating Element One of the most common applications of resistance is in household ﬁx- tures such as toasters and baseboard heating where the heat generated by current passing through a resistive element is employed to perform a useful function. Recently, as we remodeled our house, the local electrician informed us that we were limited to 16 ft of electric baseboard on a single circuit. That naturally had me wondering about the wattage per foot, the result- ing current level, and whether the 16-ft limitation was a national stan- dard. Reading the label on the 2-ft section appearing in Fig. 3.39(a), I found VOLTS AC 240/208, WATTS 750/575 [the power rating will be described in Chapter 4] AMPS 3.2/2.8. Since my panel is rated 208 V (as are those in most residential homes), the wattage rating per foot is 575 W/2 or 287.5 W at a current of 2.8 A. The total wattage for the 16 ft is therefore 16 \u0004 287.5 W or 4600 W. In Chapter 4 you will ﬁnd that the power to a resistive load is related to the current and applied voltage by the equation P \u0002 VI. The total resulting current can then be determined using this equation in the following manner: I \u0002 P/V \u0002 4600 W/208 V \u0002 22.12 A. The result was that we needed a circuit breaker larger than 22.12 A; otherwise, the circuit breaker would trip every time we turned the heat on. In my case the electrician used a 30-A breaker to meet the National Fire Code requirement that does not permit exceeding 80% of the rated current for a conductor or breaker. In most panels a 30-A breaker takes two slots of your panel, whereas the more common 20-A breaker takes only one slot. If you have a moment, take a look in your own panel and note the rating of the break- ers used for various circuits of your home. Going back to Table 3.2, we ﬁnd that the #12 wire commonly used for most circuits in the home has a maximum rating of 20 A and would not be suitable for the electric baseboard. Since #11 is usually not com- mercially available, a #10 wire with a maximum rating of 30 A was used. You might wonder why the current drawn from the supply is 22.12 A while that required for one unit was only 2.8 A. This difference is due to the parallel combination of sections of the heating elements, a conﬁguration that will be described in Chapter 6. It is now clear why they specify a 16-ft limitation on a single circuit. Additional elements would raise the current to a level that would exceed the code level for #10 wire and would approach the maximum rating of the circuit breaker. Figure 3.39(b) shows a photo of the interior construction of the heat- ing element. The red feed wire on the right is connected to the core of the heating element, and the black wire at the other end passes through a protective heater element and back to the terminal box of the unit (the place where the exterior wires are brought in and connected). If you look carefully at the end of the heating unit as shown in Fig. 3.39(c), you will ﬁnd that the heating wire that runs through the core of the heater is not connected directly to the round jacket holding the ﬁns in place. A ceramic material (insulator) separates the heating wire from R G the ﬁns to remove any possibility of conduction between the current passing through the bare heating element and the outer ﬁn structure. Ceramic materials are used because they are excellent conductors of heat and because they have a high retentivity for heat so the surround- ing area will remain heated for a period of time even after the current has been turned off. As shown in Fig. 3.39(d), the heating wire that runs through the metal jacket is normally a nichrome composite (because pure nichrome is quite brittle) wound in the shape of a coil to compen- sate for expansion and contraction with heating and also to permit a 86  RESISTANCE FIG. 3.39 Electric baseboard: (a) 2-ft section; (b) interior; (c) heating element; (d) nichrome coil. \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0003 \u000b\f\b\u0005 \r\b\u000e\u0006\u0005\u000f\u0006\f\u0010\u0005 \u0006\u0011\u0005\b\u0012\u0013\u0014 \u0005\u0014\u0005\u0012\u0005\t\u0006 \u0015\f\u0014\u0016\u0017\f\u0014\u0014\u0005˘ \u000f\u000eˇˇ\u0005\b \u0006\u0007\u0001\f\tˆ \u0003˙\u0005\u0005˘\u0003 \u000b\f\b\u0005 ˝\u0005\u0013\u0006\f\tˆ \u0017\f\t˛ \u0000\u000f\u0002 ˙\u0005\u0005˘ \u000b\f\b\u0005 ˚ˇ\u0005\u000f\f\u0013\u0014 \u000f\u000e\t\t\u0005\u000f\u0006\f\u000e\t ˜\u0005\u0006\u0013\u0014 \u0013\u000f!\u0005\u0006 \u0013\t˘ \u0017\f\t˛ \u0017\u000e\b \u0011\u0005\u0013\u0006 \u0006\b\u0013\t˛\u0017\u0005\b \"\f\u000f\u0011\b\u000e\u0012\u0005 \u000f\u000e\b\u0005 #\u0005\b\u0013\u0012\f\u000f \f\t˛\u0007\u0014\u0013\u0006\u000e\b \u0000˘\u0002 $\t˛\u0007\u0014\u0013\u0006\u000e\b \"\f\u000f\u0011\b\u000e\u0012\u0005 \u000f\u000e\f\u0014 ˜\u0005\u0006\u0013\u0014 \u0013\u000f!\u0005\u0006 \u0000\u0013\u0002 R G longer heating element in standard-length baseboard. For interest sake we opened up the core and found that the nichrome wire in the core of a 2-ft baseboard was actually 7 ft long, or a 3.5 : 1 ratio. The thinness of the wire was particularly noteworthy, measuring out at about 8 mils in diameter, not much thicker than a hair. Recall from this chapter that the longer the conductor and the thinner the wire, the greater the resis- tance. We took a section of the nichrome wire and tried to heat it with a reasonable level of current and the application of a hair dryer. The change in resistance was almost unnoticeable. In other words, all our effort to increase the resistance with the basic elements available to us in the lab was fruitless. This was an excellent demonstration of the meaning of the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance in Table 3.6. Since the coefﬁcient is so small for nichrome, the resistance does not measur- ably change unless the change in temperature is truly signiﬁcant. The curve of Fig. 3.14 would therefore be close to horizontal for nichrome. For baseboard heaters this is an excellent characteristic because the heat developed, and the power dissipated, will not vary with time as the con- ductor heats up with time. The ﬂow of heat from the unit will remain fairly constant. The feed and return cannot be soldered to the nichrome heater wire for two reasons. First, you cannot solder nichrome wires to each other or to other types of wire. Second, if you could, there could be a prob- lem because the heat of the unit could rise above 880°F at the point where the wires are connected, and the solder could melt and the con- nection could be broken. Nichrome must be spot welded or crimped onto the copper wires of the unit. Using Eq. (3.1) and the 8-mil mea- sured diameter, and assuming pure nichrome for the moment, the resis- tance of the 7-ft length is R \u0002 \u0003 r A l \u0003 \u0002 \u0003 ( ( 6 8 0 m 0) i ( ls 7 ) \b 2 )\u0003 \u0002 \u0003 42 60 40 \u0003 R \u0002 65.6 \u0002 In the next chapter a power equation will be introduced in detail relating power, current, and resistance in the following manner: P \u0002 I 2R. Using the above data and solving for the resistance, we obtain R \u0002 \u0003 I P 2\u0003 \u0002 \u0003 ( 5 2 7 .8 5A W ) 2\u0003 R \u0002 73.34 \u0002 which is very close to the value calculated above from the geometric shape since we cannot be absolutely sure about the resistivity value for the composite. During normal operation the wire heats up and passes that heat on to the ﬁns, which in turn heat the room via the air ﬂowing through them. The ﬂow of air through the unit is enhanced by the fact that hot air rises, so when the heated air leaves the top of the unit, it draws cold area from the bottom to contribute to the convection effect. Closing off the top or bottom of the unit would effectively eliminate the convection effect, and the room would not heat up. A condition could occur in which the inside of the heater became too hot, causing the metal casing APPLICATIONS  87 R G also to get too hot. This concern is the primary reason for the thermal protective element introduced above and appearing in Fig. 3.39(b). The long, thin copper tubing in Fig. 3.39 is actually ﬁlled with an oil-type ﬂuid that will expand when heated. If too hot, it will expand, depress a switch in the housing, and turn off the heater by cutting off the current to the heater wire. Dimmer Control in an Automobile A two-point rheostat is the primary element in the control of the light intensity on the dashboard and accessories of a car. The basic network appears in Fig. 3.40 with typical voltage and current levels. When the light switch is closed (usually by pulling the light control knob out from the dashboard), current will be established through the 50-\u0001 rheostat and then to the various lights on the dashboard. As the knob of the con- trol switch is turned, it will control the amount of resistance between points a and b of the rheostat. The more resistance between points a and b, the less the current and the less the brightness of the various lights. Note the additional switch in the glove compartment light which is acti- vated by the opening of the door of the compartment. Aside from the glove compartment light, all the lights of Fig. 3.40 will be on at the same time when the light switch is activated. The ﬁrst branch after the rheo- stat contains two bulbs of 6-V rating rather than the 12-V bulbs appear- ing in the other branches. The smaller bulbs of this branch will produce a softer, more even light for speciﬁc areas of the panel. Note that the sum of the two bulbs (in series) is 12 V to match that across the other branches. The division of voltage in any network will be covered in detail in Chapters 5 and 6. Typical current levels for the various branches have also been pro- vided in Fig. 3.40. You will learn in Chapter 6 that the current drain from the battery and through the fuse and rheostat approximately equals the sum of the currents in the branches of the network. The result is that the fuse must be able to handle current in amperes, so a 15-A fuse was employed (even though the bulbs appear in Fig. 3.40 as 12-V bulbs to match the battery). Whenever the operating voltage and current levels of a component are known, the internal “hot” resistance of the unit can be determined using Ohm’s law, to be introduced in detail in the next chapter.

For the 12-V bulb at a rated current of 300 mA, the resistance is R \u0002 V/I \u0002 12 V/300 mA \u0002 40 \u0001. For the 6-V bulbs it is 6 V/300 mA \u0002 80 \u0001. Fur- ther comment regarding the power levels and resistance levels will be reserved for the chapters to follow. The preceding description assumed an ideal level of 12 V for the bat- tery. In actuality, 6.3-V and 14-V bulbs are used to match the charging level of most automobiles. Strain Gauges Any change in the shape of a structure can be detected using strain gauges whose resistance will change with applied stress or ﬂex. An example of a strain gauge is shown in Fig. 3.41. Strain gauges are semi- conductor devices whose terminal resistance will change in a nonlinear (not a straight-line) fashion through a fairly wide range in values when they are stressed by compression or extension. Since the stress gauge does emit a signal, a signal processor must also be part of the system to translate the change in resistance to some meaningful output. One sim- ple example of the use of resistive strain gauges is to monitor earth- quake activity. When the gauge is placed across an area of suspected earthquake activity, the slightest separation in the earth will change the terminal resistance, and the processor will display a result sensitive to the amount of separation. Another example is in alarm systems where the slightest change in the shape of a supporting beam when someone walks overhead will result in a change in terminal resistance, and an alarm will sound. Other examples include placing strain gauges on bridges to maintain an awareness of their rigidity and on very large gen- erators to check whether various moving components are beginning to separate because of a wearing of the bearings or spacers.

There is no need to obtain a copy of the software package to continue with the material covered in this text. The coverage is at a very introductory level simply to introduce the scope and power of the package. All the exercises appearing at the end of each chapter can be done without Mathcad. Once the package is installed, all operations begin with the basic screen of Fig. 3.42. The operations must be performed in the sequence appearing in Fig. 3.43, that is, from left to right and then from top to bottom. For example, if an equation on the second line is to operate on a speciﬁc variable, the variable must be deﬁned to the left of or above the equation. 90  RESISTANCE FIG. 3.42 Using Mathcad to perform a basic mathematical operation.

As an example in which variables must be deﬁned, the resistance of a 200-ft length of copper wire with a diameter of 0.01 in. will be determined. First, as shown in Fig. 3.44, the variables for resistivity, length, and diameter must be deﬁned. This is accomplished by ﬁrst calling for the Greek palette through View-Toolbars-Greek and selecting the Greek letter rho (r) followed by a combined Shift-colon (Shift:) operation. A colon and an equal sign will appear, after which 10.37 is entered. For all the calculations to follow, the value of r has been deﬁned. A left click on the screen will then remove the rectan- gular enclosure and place the variable and its value in memory. Pro- ceed in the same way to deﬁne the length l and the diameter d. Next the diameter in millimeters is deﬁned by multiplying the diameter in inches by 1000, and the area is deﬁned by the diameter in millimeters squared. Note that m had to be deﬁned to the left of the expression for the area, and the variable d was deﬁned in the line above. The power of 2 was obtained by ﬁrst selecting the superscript symbol (^) at the top of the number 6 on the keyboard and then entering the number 2 in the Mathcad bracket. Or you can simply type the letter m and choose from the Calculator palette. In fact, all the operations of multiplication, division, etc., required to determine the resistance R can be lifted from the Calculator palette. On the next line of Fig. 3.44, the values of m and A were calculated by simply typing in m followed by the keyboard equal sign. Finally, the x2 FIG. 3.43 Deﬁning the order of mathematical operations for Mathcad. FIG. 3.44 Using Mathcad to calculate the resistance of a copper conductor. 92  RESISTANCE 12.

Repeat (c) for an increase in cross-sectional area. equation for the resistance R is deﬁned in terms of the variables, and the result is obtained. The true value of developing in the above sequence is the fact that you can place the program in memory and, when the need arises, call it up and change a variable or two—the result will appear immediately. There is no need to reenter all the deﬁnitions—just change the numerical value. In the chapters to follow, Mathcad will appear at every opportunity to demonstrate its ability to perform calculations in a quick, effective manner. You will probably want to learn more about this time-saving and accuracy-checking option. PROBLEMS SECTION 3.2 Resistance: Circular Wires 1.

Ohm’s Law, Power, and Energy 4.1 OHM’S LAW Consider the following relationship: (4.1) Every conversion of energy from one form to another can be related to this equation. In electric circuits, the effect we are trying to establish is the ﬂow of charge, or current. The potential difference, or voltage, between two points is the cause (“pressure”), and the opposition is the resistance encountered. An excellent analogy for the simplest of electrical circuits is the water in a hose connected to a pressure valve. Think of the electrons in the copper wire as the water in the hose, the pressure valve as the applied voltage, and the size of the hose as the factor that determines the resistance. If the pressure valve is closed, the water simply sits in the hose without motion, much like the electrons in a conductor with- out an applied voltage. When we open the pressure valve, water will ﬂow through the hose much like the electrons in a copper wire when the voltage is applied. In other words, the absence of the “pressure” in one case and the voltage in the other will simply result in a system without motion or reaction. The rate at which the water will ﬂow in the hose is a function of the size of the hose. A hose with a very small diameter will limit the rate at which water can ﬂow through the hose, just as a copper wire with a small diameter will have a high resistance and will limit the current. In summary, therefore, the absence of an applied “pressure” such as voltage in an electric circuit will result in no reaction in the system and no current in the electric circuit. Current is a reaction to the applied voltage and not the factor that gets the system in motion. To continue with the analogy, the more the pressure at the spigot, the more the rate Effect \u0001 \u0002 opp ca o u s s it e ion\u0002 V IR V IR4 98  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY of water ﬂow through the hose, just as applying a higher voltage to the same circuit will result in a higher current. Substituting the terms introduced above into Eq. (4.1) results in Current \u0001 and (amperes, A) (4.2) Equation (4.2) is known as Ohm’s law in honor of Georg Simon Ohm (Fig. 4.1). The law clearly reveals that for a ﬁxed resistance, the greater the voltage (or pressure) across a resistor, the more the current, and the more the resistance for the same voltage, the less the current. In other words, the current is proportional to the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance. By simple mathematical manipulations, the voltage and resistance can be found in terms of the other two quantities: (volts, V) (4.3) and (ohms, \u0003) (4.4) The three quantities of Eqs. (4.2) through (4.4) are deﬁned by the simple circuit of Fig. 4.2. The current I of Eq. (4.2) results from apply- ing a dc supply of E volts across a network having a resistance R. Equa- tion (4.3) determines the voltage E required to establish a current I through a network with a total resistance R, and Equation (4.4) provides the resistance of a network that results in a current I due to an impressed voltage E. Note in Fig. 4.2 that the voltage source “pressures” current in a direction that passes from the negative to the positive terminal of the battery. This will always be the case for single-source circuits. The effect of more than one source in the network will be examined in the chap- ters to follow. The symbol for the voltage of the battery (a source of electrical energy) is the uppercase letter E, whereas the loss in potential energy across the resistor is given the symbol V. The polarity of the voltage drop across the resistor is as deﬁned by the applied source because the two terminals of the battery are connected directly across the resistive element.

It took some 22 years for his work to be recognized as a major contribu- tion to the ﬁeld. He was then awarded a chair at the University of Munich and received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1841.

A reversal in current will reverse the polarity, as shown in Fig. 4.3(b). In general, the ﬂow of charge is from a high (\u0004) to a low (\u0005) potential. Polarities as established by current direction will become increasingly important in the analysis to follow.

This approach was used to provide an opportunity for the student to relate to real-world situations as soon as possible and to demonstrate that a number of the equations derived in this chapter are applicable to ac networks also. Chapter 13 will provide a direct relationship between ac and dc voltages that permits the math- ematical substitutions used in this chapter. In other words, don’t be con- cerned about the fact that some of the voltages and currents appearing in the examples of this chapter are actually ac voltages, because the equations for dc networks have exactly the same format, and all the solutions will be correct. 4.2 PLOTTING OHM’S LAW Graphs, characteristics, plots, and the like, play an important role in every technical ﬁeld as a mode through which the broad picture of the behavior or response of a system can be conveniently displayed. It is therefore critical to develop the skills necessary both to read data and to plot them in such a manner that they can be interpreted easily. For most sets of characteristics of electronic devices, the current is rep- resented by the vertical axis (ordinate), and the voltage by the horizontal axis (abscissa), as shown in Fig. 4.6.

For some plots, I may be inmil- liamperes (mA), microamperes (mA), or whatever is appropriate for the range of interest. The same is true for the levels of voltage on the horizon- tal axis. Note also that the chosen parameters require that the spacing between numerical values of the vertical axis be different from that of the horizontal axis. The linear (straight-line) graph reveals that the resistance is not changing with current or voltage level; rather, it is a ﬁxed quantity throughout. The current direction and the voltage polarity appearing at the top of Fig. 4.6 are the deﬁned direction and polarity for the provided plot. If the current direction is opposite to the deﬁned direction, the region below the horizontal axis is the region of interest for the current I. If the voltage polarity is opposite to that deﬁned, the region to the left of the cur- rent axis is the region of interest. For the standard ﬁxed resistor, the ﬁrst quadrant, or region, of Fig. 4.6 is the only region of interest. However, you will encounter many devices in your electronics courses that will use the other quadrants of a graph. Once a graph such as Fig. 4.6 is developed, the current or voltage at any level can be found from the other quantity by simply using the resulting plot. For instance, at V \u0001 25 V, if a vertical line is drawn on Fig. 4.6 to the curve as shown, the resulting current can be found by drawing a horizon- tal line over to the current axis, where a result of 5 A is obtained. Similarly, at V \u0001 10 V, a vertical line to the plot and a horizontal line to the current axis will result in a current of 2 A, as determined by Ohm’s law. If the resistance of a plot is unknown, it can be determined at any point on the plot since a straight line indicates a ﬁxed resistance. At any point on the plot, ﬁnd the resulting current and voltage, and simply sub- stitute into the following equation: (4.5) To test Eq. (4.5), consider a point on the plot where V \u0001 20 V and I \u0001 4 A. The resulting resistance is Rdc \u0001 V/I \u0001 20 V/4 A \u0001 5 \u0003. For comparison purposes, a 1-\u0003 and 10-\u0003 resistor were plotted on the graph of Fig. 4.7. Note that the less the resistance, the steeper the slope (closer to the vertical axis) of the curve. If we write Ohm’s law in the following manner and relate it to the basic straight-line equation we ﬁnd that the slope is equal to 1 divided by the resistance value, as indicated by the following: (4.6) where D signiﬁes a small, ﬁnite change in the variable. Equation (4.6) clearly reveals that the greater the resistance, the less the slope. If written in the following form, Equation (4.6) can be used to determine the resistance from the linear curve: m \u0001 slope \u0001 \u0002 D D y x \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 D D V I \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 R 1 \u0002 I \u0001 R 1 • E \u0004 0 \u0001ym x \u0004 b• Rdc \u0001 \u0002 V I \u0002 V IR FIG. 4.7 Demonstrating on an I-V plot that the less the resistance, the steeper is the slope.

Before leaving the subject, let us ﬁrst investigate the characteristics of a very important semiconductor device called the diode, which will be examined in detail in basic electronics courses. This device will ide- ally act like a low-resistance path to current in one direction and a high- resistance path to current in the reverse direction, much like a switch that will pass current in only one direction. A typical set of characteris- tics appears in Fig. 4.10. Without any mathematical calculations, the closeness of the characteristic to the voltage axis for negative values of applied voltage indicates that this is the low-conductance (high resis- tance, switch opened) region. Note that this region extends to approxi- mately 0.7 V positive. However, for values of applied voltage greater than 0.7 V, the vertical rise in the characteristics indicates a high- conductivity (low resistance, switch closed) region. Application of Ohm’s law will now verify the above conclusions. 2 V\u0002 1 mA DV\u0002 D I 6 V\u0002 3 mA V \u0002 I 102  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY V IR At V \u0001\u00041 V, Rdiode \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 20 \u0003 (a relatively low value for most applications) At V \u0001\u00051 V, Rdiode \u0001\u0001 \u0001 1 M\u0003 (which is often represented by an open-circuit equivalent) 4.3 POWER Power is an indication of how much work (the conversion of energy from one form to another) can be done in a speciﬁed amount of time, that is, a rate of doing work. For instance, a large motor has more power than a small motor because it can convert more electrical energy into mechanical energy in the same period of time. Since converted energy is measured in joules (J) and time in seconds (s), power is mea- sured in joules/second (J/s). The electrical unit of measurement for power is the watt (W), deﬁned by (4.8) In equation form, power is determined by (watts, W, or joules/second, J/s) (4.9) with the energy W measured in joules and the time t in seconds. Throughout the text, the abbreviation for energy (W) can be distin- guished from that for the watt (W) by the fact that one is in italics while the other is in roman. In fact, all variables in the dc section appear in italics while the units appear in roman.

He introduced the horsepower (hp) as a measure of the average power of a strong dray horse over a full work- ing day. It is approximately 50% more than can be expected from the average horse. The horsepower and watt are related in the following manner: The power delivered to, or absorbed by, an electrical device or system can be found in terms of the current and voltage by ﬁrst substituting Eq. (2.7) into Eq. (4.9): P \u0001\u0001 \u0001 V But I \u0001 so that (watts) (4.10) By direct substitution of Ohm’s law, the equation for power can be obtained in two other forms: P \u0001 VI \u0001 V\u0001\u0002 and (watts) (4.11) or P \u0001 VI \u0001 (IR)I and (watts) (4.12) The result is that the power absorbed by the resistor of Fig. 4.12 can be found directly depending on the information available. In other words, if the current and resistance are known, it pays to use Eq. (4.12) directly, and if V and I are known, use of Eq. (4.10) is appropriate. It saves having to apply Ohm’s law before determining the power. Power can be delivered or absorbed as deﬁned by the polarity of the voltage and the direction of the current. For all dc voltage sources, power is being delivered by the source if the current has the direction appearing in Fig. 4.13(a). Note that the current has the same direction as established by the source in a single-source network. If the current direction and polarity are as shown in Fig. 4.13(b) due to a multisource network, the battery is absorbing power much as when a battery is being charged. For resistive elements, all the power delivered is dissipated in the form of heat because the voltage polarity is deﬁned by the current direc- tion (and vice versa), and current will always enter the terminal of higher potential corresponding with the absorbing state of Fig. 4.13(b). A reversal of the current direction in Fig. 4.12 will also reverse the polarity of the voltage across the resistor and match the conditions of Fig. 4.13(b).

If the current coils (CC) and potential coils (PC) of the wattmeter are connected as shown in Fig. 4.17, there will be an up-scale reading on the wattmeter. A reversal of either coil will result in a below-zero indi- cation. Three voltage terminals may be available on the voltage side to permit a choice of voltage levels. On most wattmeters, the current ter- minals are physically larger than the voltage terminals to provide safety and to ensure a solid connection. 4.5 EFFICIENCY A ﬂowchart for the energy levels associated with any system that con- verts energy from one form to another is provided in Fig. 4.18. Take particular note of the fact that the output energy level must always be less than the applied energy due to losses and storage within the system. The best one can hope for is that Wo and Wi are relatively close in mag- nitude.

Expressed as a percentage, (percent) (4.18) In terms of the input and output energy, the efﬁciency in percent is given by (percent) (4.19) The maximum possible efﬁciency is 100%, which occurs when Po \u0001 Pi, or when the power lost or stored in the system is zero. Obviously, the greater the internal losses of the system in generating the necessary output power or energy, the lower the net efﬁciency. EXAMPLE 4.10 A 2-hp motor operates at an efﬁciency of 75%.

The total efﬁciency of a cascaded system is therefore determined primarily by the lowest efﬁ- ciency (weakest link) and is less than (or equal to if the remaining efﬁ- ciencies are 100%) the least efﬁcient link of the system. 4.6 ENERGY For power, which is the rate of doing work, to produce an energy con- version of any form, it must be used over a period of time. For example, a motor may have the horsepower to run a heavy load, but unless the motor is used over a period of time, there will be no energy conversion. In addition, the longer the motor is used to drive the load, the greater will be the energy expended. The energy (W) lost or gained by any system is therefore determined by (wattseconds, Ws, or joules) (4.21)W \u0001 Pt ENERGY  109 Since power is measured in watts (or joules per second) and time in seconds, the unit of energy is the wattsecond or joule (note Fig. 4.21) as indicated above. The wattsecond, however, is too small a quantity for most practical purposes, so the watthour (Wh) and kilowatthour (kWh) were deﬁned, as follows: (4.22) Energy (kWh) \u0001 (4.23) Note that the energy in kilowatthours is simply the energy in watthours divided by 1000. To develop some sense for the kilowatthour energy level, consider that 1 kWh is the energy dissipated by a 100-W bulb in 10 h. The kilowatthour meter is an instrument for measuring the energy supplied to the residential or commercial user of electricity. It is normally connected directly to the lines at a point just prior to entering the power distribution panel of the building. A typical set of dials is shown in Fig. 4.22(a) with a photograph of an analog kilowatthour meter. As indicated, each power of ten below a dial is in kilowatthours. The more rapidly the aluminum disc rotates, the greater the energy demand. The dials are con- nected through a set of gears to the rotation of this disc.

In 1841 introduced Joule’s law, which stated that the heat developed by electric current in a wire is proportional to the prod- uct of the current squared and the resistance of the wire (I2R). He further determined that the heat emit- ted was equivalent to the power absorbed and there- fore heat is a form of energy.

To limit the current level, fuses or circuit breakers are installed where the power enters the installation, such as in the panel in the basement of most homes at the point where the outside feeder lines enter the dwelling. The fuses of Fig. 4.24 have an internal metallic con- ductor through which the current will pass; a fuse will begin to melt if the current through the system exceeds the rated value printed on the casing. Of course, if the fuse melts through, the current path is broken and the load in its path is protected. In homes built in recent years, fuses have been replaced by circuit breakers such as those appearing in Fig. 4.25. When the current exceeds rated conditions, an electromagnet in the device will have sufﬁcient strength to draw the connecting metallic link in the breaker out of the circuit and open the current path. When conditions have been corrected, the breaker can be reset and used again. V IR FIG. 4.24 Fuses: (a) CC-TRON ® (0–10 A); (b) subminiature solid matrix; (c) Semitron (0–600 A).

FIG. 4.26 Ground fault current interrupter (GFCI) 125-V ac, 60-Hz, 15-A outlet. (Courtesy of Leviton, Inc.) The most recent National Electrical Code requires that outlets in the bathroom and other sensitive areas be of the ground fault current inter- rupt (GFCI) variety; GCFIs are designed to trip more quickly than the standard circuit breaker. The commercial unit of Fig. 4.26 trips in 5 ns. It has been determined that 6 mA is the maximum level that most individuals can be exposed to for a short period of time without the risk of serious injury. A current higher than 11 mA can cause involuntary APPLICATIONS  113 muscle contractions that could prevent a person from letting go of the conductor and possibly cause him or her to enter a state of shock. Higher currents lasting more than a second can cause the heart to go into ﬁbrillation and possibly cause death in a few minutes. The GFCI is able to react as quickly as it does by sensing the difference between the input and output currents to the outlet; the currents should be the same if everything is working properly. An errant path such as through an individual establishes a difference in the two current levels and causes the breaker to trip and disconnect the power source. 4.8 APPLICATIONS Microwave Oven It is probably safe to say that most modern homeowners have a microwave oven such as appearing in Fig. 4.27(a)—even those of us who went through the phase of worrying about whether it was safe and whether it was a proper way to prepare food. Now we use the oven so often during the day that we wonder how we ever did without it before. For most users, its operating efﬁciency is not the biggest concern, prob- ably because its impact on the monthly bill is not that easy to deﬁne with so many appliances in the home. However, it might be of some interest to examine the unit in more detail and apply some of the theory presented in this chapter. V IR FIG. 4.27 Microwave oven: (a) photo; (b) basic construction. (a) Cutaway view Magnetron ac dc power conversion Potato Microwave energy (b) ac + – Door First, some general comments. Most microwaves are rated at 500 W to 1200 W at a frequency of 2.45 GHz (almost 2.5 billion cycles per second compared to the 60 cycles per second for the ac voltage at the typical home outlet—details in Chapter 13). The heating occurs because the water molecules in the food are vibrated at such a high fre- quency that the friction with neighboring molecules causes the heating effect. Since it is the high frequency of vibration that heats the food, there is no need for the material to be a conductor of electricity. How- ever, any metal placed in the microwave can act as an antenna (espe- 114  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY cially if it has any points or sharp edges) that will attract the microwave energy and reach very high temperatures. In fact, a browning skillet is now made for microwaves that has some metal embedded in the bottom and sides to attract the microwave energy and raise the temperature at the surface between the food and skillet to give the food a brown color and a crisp texture. Even if the metal did not act as an antenna, it is a good conductor of heat and could get quite hot as it draws heat from the food. Any container with low moisture content can be used to heat foods in a microwave. Because of this requirement, manufacturers have developed a whole line of microwave cookware that is very low in moisture content. Theoretically, glass and plastic have very little mois- ture content, but even so when heated in the oven for a minute or so, they do get warm. It could be the moisture in the air that clings to the surface of each or perhaps the lead used in good crystal. In any case, microwaves should be used only to prepare food. They were not designed to be dryers or evaporators. The instructions with every microwave specify that the oven should not be turned on when empty. Even though the oven may be empty, microwave energy will be gener- ated and will make every effort to ﬁnd a channel for absorption. If the oven is empty, the energy might be attracted to the oven itself and could do some damage. To demonstrate that a dry empty glass or plastic con- tainer will not attract a signiﬁcant amount of microwave energy, place two glasses in an oven, one with water and the other empty. After one minute you will ﬁnd the glass with the water quite warm due to the heating effect of the hot water while the other is close to its original temperature. In other words, the water created a heat sink for the major- ity of the microwave energy, leaving the empty glass as a less attractive path for heat conduction. Dry paper towels and plastic wrap can be used in the oven to cover dishes since they initially have low water molecule content, and paper and plastic are not good conductors of heat. How- ever, it would very unsafe to place a paper towel in an oven alone because, as said above, the microwave energy will look for an absorb- ing medium and could set the paper on ﬁre. The cooking of food by a conventional oven is from the outside in. The same is true for microwave ovens, but they have the additional advantage of being able to penetrate the outside few centimeters of the food, reducing the cooking time substantially. The cooking time with a microwave oven is related to the amount of food in the oven. Two cups of water will take longer to heat than one cup, although it is not a lin- ear relationship so it won’t take twice as long—perhaps 75% to 90% longer. Eventually, if you place enough food in the microwave oven and compare the longer cooking time to that with a conventional oven, you will reach a crossover point where it would be just as wise to use a con- ventional oven and get the texture in the food you might prefer. The basic construction of the microwave is depicted in Fig. 4.27(b). It uses a 120-V ac supply which is then converted through a high- voltage transformer to one having peak values approaching 5000 V (at substantial current levels)—sufﬁcient warning to leave microwave repair to the local service location. Through the rectifying process brieﬂy described in Chapter 2, a high dc voltage of a few thousand volts will be generated that will appear across a magnetron. The magnetron, through its very special design (currently the same design as in WW II when it was invented by the British for their high-power radar units), will generate the required 2.45-GHz signal for the oven. It should be pointed out also that the magnetron has a speciﬁc power level of oper- V IRAPPLICATIONS  115 ation that cannot be controlled—once it’s on, it’s on at a set power level. One may then wonder how the cooking temperature and duration can be controlled. This is accomplished through a controlling network that determines the amount of off and on time during the input cycle of the 120-V supply. Higher temperatures are achieved by setting a high ratio of on to off time, while low temperatures are set by the reverse action. One unfortunate characteristic of the magnetron is that in the conver- sion process, it generates a great deal of heat that does not go toward the heating of the food and that must be absorbed by heat sinks or dispersed by a cooling fan. Typical conversion efﬁciencies are between 55% and 75%. Considering other losses inherent in any operating system, it is reasonable to assume that most microwaves are between 50% and 60% efﬁcient. However, the conventional oven with its continually operating exhaust fan and heating of the oven, cookware, surrounding air, and so on, also has signiﬁcant losses, even if it is less sensitive to the amount of food to be cooked. All in all, the convenience factor is probably the other factor that weighs the heaviest in this discussion. It also leaves the question of how our time is ﬁgured into the efﬁciency equation. For speciﬁc numbers, let us consider the energy associated with bak- ing a 5-oz potato in a 1200-W microwave oven for 5 min if the conver- sion efﬁciency is an average value of 55%. First, it is important to real- ize that when a unit is rated as 1200 W, that is the rated power drawn from the line during the cooking process. If the microwave is plugged into a 120-V outlet, the current drawn is I \u0001 P/V \u0001 1200 W/120 V \u0001 10.0 A which is a signiﬁcant level of current. Next, we can determine the amount of power dedicated solely to the cooking process by using the efﬁciency level. That is, Po \u0001 hPi \u0001 (0.55)(1200 W) \u0001 600 W The energy transferred to the potato over a period of 5 min can then be determined from W \u0001 Pt \u0001 (660 W)(5 min)(60 s/1 min) \u0001 198 kJ which is about half of the energy (nutritional value) derived from eating a 5-oz potato. The number of kilowatthours drawn by the unit is deter- mined from W \u0001 Pt/1000 \u0001 (1200 W)(5/60 h)/1000 \u0001 0.1 kWh At a rate of 10¢/kWh we ﬁnd that we can cook the potato for 1 penny— relatively speaking, pretty cheap. A typical 1550-W toaster oven would take an hour to heat the same potato, resulting in 1.55 kWh and a cost of 15.5 cents—a signiﬁcant increase in cost. Household Wiring A number of facets of household wiring can be discussed without examining the manner in which they are physically connected. In the chapters to follow, additional coverage will be provided to ensure that you develop a solid fundamental understanding of the overall household wiring system. At the very least you will establish a background that will permit you to answer questions that you should be able to answer as a student of this ﬁeld. V IR116  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY The one speciﬁcation that deﬁnes the overall system is the maximum current that can be drawn from the power lines since the voltage is ﬁxed at 120 V or 208 V (depending on how the power lines are utilized). For most older homes with a heating system other than electric, a 100-A ser- vice is the norm. Today, with all the electronic systems becoming com- monplace in the home, many people are opting for the 200-A service even if they don’t have electric heat. A 100-A service speciﬁes that the maximum current that can be drawn through the power lines into your home is 100 A. Using the line-to-line rated voltage and the full-service current (and assuming all resistive-type loads), we can determine the maximum power that can be delivered using the basic power equation: P \u0001 EI \u0001 (208 V)(100 A) \u0001 20,800 W \u0001 20.8 kW This rating reveals that the total rating of all the units turned on in the home cannot exceed 20.8 kW at any one time. If it did, we could expect the main breaker at the top of the power panel to open. Initially, 20.8 kW may seem like quite a large rating, but when you consider that a self- cleaning electric oven may draw 12.2 kW, a dryer 4.8 kW, a water heater 4.5 kW, and a dishwasher 1.2 kW, we are already at 22.7 kW (if all the units are operating at peak demand), and we haven’t turned the lights or TV on yet. Obviously, the use of an electric oven alone may strongly suggest considering a 200-A service. However, one must be aware that seldom are all the burners of a stove used at once, and the oven incorporates a thermostat to control the temperature so that it is not on all the time. The same is true for the water heater and dish- washer, so the chances of all the units in a home demanding full service at the same time is very slim. Certainly, a typical home with electric heat that may draw 16 kW just for heating in cold weather must con- sider a 200-A service. One must also understand that there is some lee- way in maximum ratings for safety purposes. In other words, a system designed for a maximum load of 100 A can accept a slightly higher cur- rent for short periods of time without signiﬁcant damage. For the long term, however, it should not be exceeded. Changing the service to 200 A is not simply a matter of changing the panel in the basement—a new, heavier line must be run from the road to the house. In some areas feeder cables are aluminum because of the reduced cost and weight. In other areas, aluminum is not permitted because of its temperature sensitivity (expansion and contraction), and copper must be used. In any event, when aluminum is used, the con- tractor must be absolutely sure that the connections at both ends are very secure. The National Electric Code speciﬁes that 100-A service must use a #4 AWG copper conductor or #2 aluminum conductor. For 200-A service, a 2/0 copper wire or a 4/0 aluminum conductor must be used as shown in Fig. 4.28(a). A 100-A or 200-A service must have two lines and a service neutral as shown in Fig. 4.28(b). Note in Fig. 4.28(b) that the lines are coated and insulated from each other, and the service neutral is spread around the inside of the wire coating. At the terminal point, all the strands of the service neutral are gathered together and securely attached to the panel. It is fairly obvious that the cables of Fig. 4.28(a) are stranded for added ﬂexibility. Within the system the incoming power is broken down into a num- ber of circuits with lower current ratings utilizing 15-A, 20-A, 30-A, and 40-A protective breakers. Since the load on each breaker should not exceed 80% of its rating, in a 15-A breaker the maximum current should be limited to 80% of 15 A or 12 A, with 16 A for a 20-A V IRAPPLICATIONS  117 breaker, 24 A for a 30-A breaker, and 32 A for a 40-A breaker. The result is that a home with 200-A service can theoretically have a maxi- mum of 12 circuits (200 A/16 A \u0001 12.5) utilizing the 16-A maximum current ratings associated with 20-A breakers. However, if aware of the loads on each circuit, the electrician can install as many circuits as he feels appropriate. The code further speciﬁes that a #14 wire shall not carry a current in excess of 15 A, a #12 in excess of 20 A, and a #10 in excess of 30 A. Thus, #12 wire is now the most common for general home wiring to ensure that it can handle any excursions beyond 15 A on the 20-A breaker (the most common breaker size). The #14 wire is often used in conjunction with the #12 wire in areas where it is known that the current levels are limited. The #10 wire is typically used for high-demand appliances such as dryers and ovens. The circuits them- selves are usually broken down into those that provide lighting, outlets, and so on. Some circuits (such as ovens and dryers) require a higher voltage of 208 V, obtained by using two power lines and the neutral. The higher voltage reduces the current requirement for the same power rating with the net result that the appliance can usually be smaller. For example, the size of an air conditioner with the same cooling ability is measurably smaller when designed for a 208-V line than when designed for 120 V. Most 208-V lines, however, demand a current level that requires 30-A or 40-A breakers and special outlets to ensure that appliances rated at 120 V are not connected to the same outlet. If time permits, check the panel in your home and take note of the number of circuits—in particular the rating of each breaker and the number of 208-V lines indicated by breakers requiring two slots of the panel. Total the current ratings of all the breakers in your panel, and explain, using the above information, why the total exceeds your feed level. For safety sake, grounding is a very important part of the electrical system in your home. The National Electric Code requires that the neu- tral wire of the above system be grounded to an earth-driven rod, a metallic water piping system of 10 ft or more, or a buried metal plate. That ground is then passed on through the electrical circuits of the home for further protection. In a later chapter the details of the connec- tions and grounding methods will be introduced.

As men- tioned in Chapter 1, three software packages will be introduced to demonstrate the options available with each and the differences that exist. All have a broad range of support in the educational and industrial communities. The student version of PSpice (OrCAD Release 9.2 from Cadence Design Systems) will receive the most attention, followed by Electronics Workbench from Multisim and then a few sample programs using a programming language called C\u0004\u0004. Each approach has its own characteristics with procedures that must be followed exactly; other- wise, error messages will appear. Do not assume that you can “force” the system to respond the way you would prefer—every step is well deﬁned, and one error on the input side can result in results of a mean- ingless nature. At times you may believe that the system is in error because you are absolutely sure you followed every step correctly. In such cases, accept the fact that something was entered incorrectly, and review all your work very carefully. All it takes is a comma instead of a period or a decimal point to generate incorrect results. Be patient with the learning process; keep notes of speciﬁc maneu- vers that you learn; and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. For each approach there is always the initial concern about how to start and proceed through the ﬁrst phases of the analysis. However, be assured that with time and exposure you will work through the required maneuvers at a speed you never would have expected. In time you will be absolutely delighted with the results you can obtain using computer methods. In this section, Ohm’s law will be investigated using the software packages PSpice and Electronics Workbench (EWB) to analyze the cir- cuit in Fig. 4.29. Both require that the circuit ﬁrst be “drawn” on the computer screen and then analyzed (simulated) to obtain the desired results. As mentioned above, the analysis program is ﬁxed in stone and cannot be changed by the user. The proﬁcient user is one who can draw the most out of a computer software package. In a later chapter, the C\u0004\u0004 programming language will be introduced in some detail to demonstrate how a user can control the analysis procedure and how the results are displayed. Although the author feels that there is sufﬁcient material in the text to carry a new student of the material through the programs provided, be aware that this is not a computer text. Rather, it is one whose pri- mary purpose is simply to introduce the different approaches and how they can be applied effectively. Today, some excellent texts and manu- als are available that cover the material in a great deal more detail and perhaps at a slower pace. In fact, the quality of the available literature has improved dramatically in recent years. PSpice Readers who were familiar with older versions of PSpice such as ver- sion 8 will ﬁnd that the major changes in this latest 9.2 version are pri- marily in the front end and the simulation process. After executing a few programs, you will ﬁnd that most of the procedures you learned from older versions will be applicable here also—at least the sequential process has a number of strong similarities. V IR FIG. 4.29 Circuit to be analyzed using PSpice and Electronics Workbench. R 4 kΩ Is E 12 V VR + – V IR COMPUTER ANALYSIS  119 Once 9.2 OrCAD Lite has been installed, the ﬁrst required procedure is to open a Folder in the C: drive for storage of the circuit ﬁles that will result from the analysis. Be aware, however, that once the folder has been deﬁned, it does not have to be deﬁned for each new project unless you choose to do so. If you are satisﬁed with one location (folder) for all your projects, this is a one-time operation that does not have to be repeated with each network. To establish the Folder, simply right-click the mouse on Start to obtain a listing that includes Explore. Select Explore, and then use the sequence File-New Folder to obtain a new folder on the screen waiting for a name. Type in PSpice (the author’s choice) followed by a left click of the mouse to install. Then exit (using the X at the top right of the screen) the Exploring-Start Menu, and the ﬁrst step is complete— you’re on your way. The folder PSpice has been established for all the projects you plan to work on in this text. Our ﬁrst project can now be initiated by double-clicking on the Orcad Lite Edition icon on the screen, or you can use the sequence Start-Programs-Orcad Family Release 9.2 Lite Edition. The result- ing screen has only a few active keys on the top toolbar. The ﬁrst at the top left is the Create new document key (or you can use the sequence File-New Project). Selecting the key will result in a New Project dia- log box in which the Name of the project must be entered. For our pur- poses we will choose Ohmslaw as shown in the heading of Fig. 4.30 and select Analog or Mixed A/D (to be used for all the analyses of this text). Note at the bottom of the dialog box that the Location appears as C:\\PSpice as set above. Click OK, and another dialog box will appear FIG. 4.30 Using PSpice to determine the voltage, current, and power levels for the circuit of Fig. 4.29. 120  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY V IR titled Create PSpice Project. Select Create a blank project (again, for all the analyses to be performed in this text). Click OK, and a third toolbar will appear at the top of the screen with some of the keys enabled. A Project Manager Window will appear with Ohmslaw as its heading. The new project listing will appear with an icon and an associ- ated \u0004 sign in a small square. Clicking on the \u0004 sign will take the list- ing a step further to SCHEMATIC1. Click \u0004 again, and PAGE1 will appear; clicking on a \u0005 sign will reverse the process. Double-clicking on PAGE1 will create a working window titled SCHEMATIC1: PAGE1, revealing that a project can have more than one schematic ﬁle and more than one associated page. The width and height of the window can be adjusted by grabbing an edge to obtain a double-headed arrow and dragging the border to the desired location. Either window on the screen can be moved by clicking on the top heading to make it dark blue and then dragging it to any location. Now we are ready to build the simple circuit of Fig. 4.29. Select the Place a part key (the second key from the top of the toolbar on the right) to obtain the Place Part dialog box. Since this is the ﬁrst circuit to be constructed, we must ensure that the parts appear in the list of active libraries. Select Add Library-Browse File, and select analog.olb, eval.olb, and source.olb. When each appears under the File name heading, select Open. All three ﬁles will be required to build the networks appearing in this text. However, it is important to realize that once the library ﬁles have been selected, they will appear in the active listing for each new project without having to add them each time—a step, such as the Folder step above, that does not have to be repeated with each similar project. Click OK, and we can now place components on the screen. For the dc voltage source, ﬁrst select the Place a part key and then select SOURCE in the library listing. Under Part List, a list of available sources will appear; select VDC for this project. Once VDC has been selected, its symbol, label, and value will appear on the picture window at the bottom right of the dialog box. Click OK, and the VDC source will follow the cursor across the screen. Move it to a convenient loca- tion, left-click the mouse, and it will be set in place as shown in Fig. 4.30. Since only one source is required, a right click of the mouse will result in a list of options, in which End Mode appears at the top. Choosing this option will end the procedure, leaving the source in a red dashed box. The fact that it is red indicates that it is an active mode and can be operated on. One more left click of the mouse, and the source will be in place and the red active status removed. One of the most important steps in the procedure is to ensure that a 0-V ground potential is deﬁned for the network so that voltages at any point in the network have a reference point. The result is a requirement that every network must have a ground deﬁned. For our purposes, the 0/SOURCE option will be our choice when the GND key is selected. It will ensure that one side of the source is deﬁned as 0 V. Finally, we need to add a resistor to the network by selecting the Place a part key again and then selecting the ANALOG library. Scrolling the options, note that R will appear and should be selected. Click OK, and the resis- tor will appear next to the cursor on the screen. Move it to the desired location and click it in place. Then right-click the mouse and End Mode, and the resistor has been entered into the schematic’s memory. V IR COMPUTER ANALYSIS  121 Unfortunately, the resistor ended up in the horizontal position, and the circuit of Fig. 4.29 has the resistor in the vertical position. No problem: Simply select the resistor again to make it red, and right-click the mouse. A listing will appear in which Rotate is an option. It will turn the resistor 90° in the counterclockwise direction. It can also be rotated 90° by simultaneously selecting Ctrl-R. All the required elements are on the screen, but they need to be con- nected. This is accomplished by selecting the Place a wire key that looks like a step in the right toolbar. The result is a crosshair with the center that should be placed at the point to be connected. Place the crosshair at the top of the voltage source, and left-click it once to con- nect it to that point. Then draw a line to the end of the next element, and click the mouse again when the crosshair is at the correct point. A red line will result with a square at each end to conﬁrm that the connection has been made. Then move the crosshair to the other elements, and build the circuit. Once everything is connected, a right click will pro- vide the End Mode option. Don’t forget to connect the source to ground as shown in Fig. 4.30. Now we have all the elements in place, but their labels and values are wrong. To change any parameter, simply double-click on the param- eter (the label or the value) to obtain the Display Properties dialog box. Type in the correct label or value, click OK, and the quantity is changed on the screen. The labels and values can be moved by simply clicking on the center of the parameter until it is closely surrounded by the four small squares and then dragging it to the new location. Another left click, and it is deposited in its new location. Finally, we can initiate the analysis process, called Simulation, by selecting the Create a new simulation proﬁle key near the top left of the display—it resembles a data page with a star in the top left corner. A New Simulation dialog box will result that ﬁrst asks for the Name of the simulation. Bias Point is selected for a dc solution, and none is left in the Inherit From request. Then select Create, and a Simulation Setting dialog box will appear in which Analysis-Analysis Type-Bias Point is sequentially selected. Click OK, and select the Run key (which looks like an isolated blue arrowhead) or choose PSpice-Run from the menu bar. An Output Window will result that appears to be somewhat inactive. It will not be used in the current analysis, so close (X) the window, and the circuit of Fig. 4.30 will appear with the volt- age, current, and power levels of the network. The voltage, current, or power levels can be removed (or replaced) from the display by simply selecting the V, I, or W in the third toolbar from the top. Individual val- ues can be removed by simply selecting the value and pressing the Delete key or the scissors key in the top menu bar. Resulting values can be moved by simply left-clicking the value and dragging it to the desired location. Note in Fig. 4.30 that the current is 3 mA (as expected) at each point in the network, and the power delivered by the source and dissipated by the resistor is the same, or 36 mW. There are also 12 V across the resis- tor as required by the conﬁguration. There is no question that the description above was long for such a trivial circuit. However, keep in mind that we needed to introduce many new facets of using PSpice that will not be touched on again in the future. By the time you ﬁnish analyzing your third or fourth network, the above procedure will appear routine and will move rather quickly. You will once again be looking for new challenges. 122  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY V IR Electronics Workbench (EWB) For comparison purposes, Electronics Workbench will be used to ana- lyze the circuit in Fig. 4.29. Although there are differences between PSpice and EWB, such as the initiation process, constructing the net- works, making the measurements, and setting up the simulation proce- dure, there are sufﬁcient similarities between the two approaches to make it easier to learn one if you are already familiar with the other. The similarities will be obvious only if you make an attempt to learn both. One of the major differences between the two is the option to use actual instruments in EWB to make the measurements—a positive trait in preparation for the laboratory experience. However, in EWB you may not ﬁnd the extensive list of options available with PSpice. In gen- eral, however, both software packages are well prepared to take us through the types of analyses to be encountered in this text. When the Multisim 2001 icon is selected from the opening window, a screen will appear with the heading Multisim-Circuit 1. A menu bar appears across the top of the screen, with one toolbar below the menu bar and one to each side of the screen. The toolbars appearing can be controlled by the sequence View-Toolbars followed by a selection of which toolbars you want to appear. For the analysis of this text, all the toolbars were selected. For the placement of components, View-Show Grid was selected so that a grid would appear on the screen. As you place an element, it will automatically be placed in a relationship spe- ciﬁc to the grid structure. Now to build the circuit of Fig. 4.29. First take the cursor and place it on the battery symbol at the top of the component toolbar at the left of the screen. One left click of the mouse, and a list of sources will appear. Place the cursor on any one of the sources, and text will appear on the screen deﬁning the type of source. Placing the cursor on the third key pad down will result in DC VOLTAGE SOURCE. Left-click again, and the battery symbol will appear on the screen next to the loca- tion of the cursor. Move the cursor to the desired location, and with a single left click of the mouse the battery symbol can be set in place. The operation is complete. If you want to delete the source, simply click on the symbol again with a left click of the mouse to create four small squares around the source. These squares indicate that the source is in the active mode and can be operated on. If you want to delete it, simply click on the Delete key or select the scissor key pad on the top toolbar. If you want to modify the source, perform a right click of the mouse outside the four small squares, and you get one list. Perform the right click within the four squares, and you have a different set of options. At any time, if you want to remove the active state, simply per- form a left click anywhere on the screen. If you want to move the source, simply click on the source symbol to create the four squares, but do not release the clicker. Hold it down and drag the source to the pre- ferred location. When the source is in place, release the clicker, and one more click will remove the active state. To remove the SOURCES tool- bar, simply click on the X in the top right corner of the toolbar. The next key down from the source key that looks like a resistor controls the display of the Basic passive components of a network. Click once on the symbol, and two columns of components will appear. From now on, whenever possible, the word click will imply a left click of the mouse. The need for a right click will continue to be spelled out. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  123 V IR For the circuit of Fig. 4.29 we need a resistor. When you place the cursor over the left resistor, the text RESISTOR will appear. When you place it over the right resistor, the text RESISTOR–VIRTUAL will appear. For all the analyses in this text using EWB, the virtual resistor will be used. The term RESISTOR is used for all resistors of a stan- dard commercial value—the values typically made commercially. The term VIRTUAL is applied to any component in which you, the user, can deﬁne the value you want. Click once on the virtual resistor, and it will appear on the screen next to the cursor in the horizontal position. In Fig. 4.29 it is in the vertical position, so a rotation must be made. This can be done by clicking on the resistor to obtain the active state and then performing a right click of the mouse within the four squares. A number of options appear, including deleting (Cut) the component, copy, change position, and color. Since we want to rotate 90° clock- wise, we select that option, and the resistor will automatically be rotated 90°. Now, as with the battery, to place the resistor in position, simply click on the resistor symbol to create the four small squares, and then, holding the left clicker down, drag the resistor to the desired posi- tion. When the resistor is in place, release the clicker, and click again to remove the four squares—the resistor is in place. Finally, we need a ground for all networks. Going back to the SOURCES parts bin, we ﬁnd that a ground is the ﬁrst option at the top of the toolbar. Select the GROUND on the left, and place it on the screen below the voltage source as shown in Fig. 4.31. Now, before connecting the components together, move the labels and the value of each component to the relative positions shown in Fig. 4.31. This is accomplished by simply clicking on the label or value to create a small FIG. 4.31 Using Electronics Workbench to determine the voltage and current level for the circuit of Fig. 4.29. set of squares around the element and then dragging the element to the desired location. Release the clicker, and then click again to set the ele- ment in place. To change the label or value, simply double-click on the label (such as V1), and a Battery dialog box will appear. Select Label and enter E as the Reference ID. Then, before leaving the dialog box, go to Value and change the value if necessary. It is very important to realize that you cannot type in the units where the V now appears. The preﬁx is controlled by the scroll keys at the left of the unit of measure. For practice, try the scroll keys, and you will ﬁnd that you can go from pV to TV. For now leave it as simply V. Click OK, and both have been changed on the screen. The same process can be applied to the resistive element to obtain the label and value appearing in Fig. 4.31. Next, we should tell the system which results should be generated and how they should be displayed. For this example we will use a mul- timeter to measure both the current and the voltage of the circuit. The Multimeter is the ﬁrst option in the list of instruments appearing in the toolbar to the right of the screen. When selected, it will appear on the screen and be placed anywhere using the same procedure deﬁned for the components above. The voltmeter was turned clockwise using the procedure described above for the elements. Double-click on either meter symbol, and a Multimeter dialog box will appear in which the function of the meter must be deﬁned. Since the meter XMM1 will be used as an ammeter, the letter A will be selected and the horizontal line to indicate dc level. There is no need to select Set for the default values since they have been chosen for the broad range of applications. The dialog meters can be moved to any location by simply clicking on their heading bar to make it dark blue and then dragging the meter to the pre- ferred position. For the voltmeter, V and the horizontal bar were selected as shown in Fig. 4.31. Finally, the elements need to be connected. This is accomplished by simply bringing the cursor to one end of an element, say, the top of the voltage source, with the result that a small dot and a crosshair will appear at the top end of the element. Click the mouse once, follow the path you want, and place the crosshair over the positive terminal of the ammeter. Then click again and the wire will appear in place. At this point you should be aware that the software package has its preferences about how it wants the elements to be connected. That is, you may try to draw it one way, but the computer generation may be a different path. In time you will be aware of those preferences and will be able to set up the network to your liking. Now continue making the connections appearing in Fig. 4.31, moving elements of adjusting lines as necessary. Be sure that the small dot appears at any point where you want a connection. Its absence suggests that the connection has not been made and the software program has not accepted the entry. Now we are ready to run the program and view the solution. The analysis can be initiated in a number of ways. One option is to select Simulate from the top toolbar, followed by RUN/STOP. Another is to select the Simulate key in the design bar grouping in the top toolbar. It appears as a sharp, jagged, green plot on a black background. The last option, and the one we will use the most, requires an OFF/ON, 0/1 switch on the screen. It is obtained through VIEW-Show Simulate Switch and will appear as shown in the top right corner of Fig. 4.31. Using this last option, the analysis (called Simulation) is initiated by placing the cursor on the 1 of the switch and left-clicking the mouse. The analysis will be performed, and the current and voltage will appear 124  OHM’S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY V IRPROBLEMS  125 PROBLEMS SECTION 4.1 Ohm’s Law 1.

Now for one of the most important things to learn about applying EWB: Always stop or end the simulation (clicking on 0 or choosing OFF) before making any changes in the network. When the simulation is initiated, it will stay in that mode until turned off. There was obviouly a great deal of material to learn in this ﬁrst exer- cise using Electronics Workbench.

One is direct current (dc), in which ideally the ﬂow of charge (current) does not change in magnitude (or direction) with time. The other is sinu- soidal alternating current (ac), in which the ﬂow of charge is continu- ally changing in magnitude (and direction) with time. The next few chapters are an introduction to circuit analysis purely from a dc approach. The methods and concepts will be discussed in detail for direct current; when possible, a short discussion will sufﬁce to cover any variations we might encounter when we consider ac in the later chapters. The battery of Fig. 5.1, by virtue of the potential difference between its terminals, has the ability to cause (or “pressure”) charge to ﬂow through the simple circuit. The positive terminal attracts the electrons through the wire at the same rate at which electrons are supplied by the negative terminal. As long as the battery is connected in the circuit and maintains its terminal characteristics, the current (dc) through the cir- cuit will not change in magnitude or direction. S Battery + – E (volts) Iconventional Ielectron I = V R E R =— + – R V — FIG. 5.1 Introducing the basic components of an electric circuit. If we consider the wire to be an ideal conductor (that is, having no opposition to ﬂow), the potential difference V across the resistor will equal the applied voltage of the battery: V (volts) \u0001 E (volts). 5 Series Circuits S The current is limited only by the resistor R. The higher the resis- tance, the less the current, and conversely, as determined by Ohm’s law. By convention (as discussed in Chapter 2), the direction of conven- tional current ﬂow Iconventional as shown in Fig. 5.1 is opposite to that of electron ﬂow (Ielectron). Also, the uniform ﬂow of charge dictates that the direct current I be the same everywhere in the circuit. By following the direction of conventional ﬂow, we notice that there is a rise in potential across the battery (\u0002 to \u0003), and a drop in potential across the resistor (\u0003 to \u0002). For single-voltage-source dc circuits, conventional ﬂow always passes from a low potential to a high potential when passing through a voltage source, as shown in Fig. 5.2. However, conventional ﬂow always passes from a high to a low potential when passing through a resistor for any number of voltage sources in the same circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.3. The circuit of Fig. 5.1 is the simplest possible conﬁguration. This chapter and the chapters to follow will add elements to the system in a very speciﬁc manner to introduce a range of concepts that will form a major part of the foundation required to analyze the most complex sys- tem. Be aware that the laws, rules, and so on, introduced in Chapters 5 and 6 will be used throughout your studies of electrical, electronic, or computer systems. They will not be dropped for a more advanced set as you progress to more sophisticated material. It is therefore critical that the concepts be understood thoroughly and that the various procedures and methods be applied with conﬁdence. 5.2 SERIES CIRCUITS A circuit consists of any number of elements joined at terminal points, providing at least one closed path through which charge can ﬂow. The circuit of Fig. 5.4(a) has three elements joined at three terminal points (a, b, and c) to provide a closed path for the current I. Two elements are in series if 1. They have only one terminal in common (i.e., one lead of one is connected to only one lead of the other). 2. The common point between the two elements is not connected to another current-carrying element. In Fig. 5.4(a), the resistors R1 and R2 are in series because they have only point b in common. The other ends of the resistors are connected elsewhere in the circuit. For the same reason, the battery E and resistor R1 are in series (terminal a in common), and the resistor R2 and the bat- tery E are in series (terminal c in common). Since all the elements are in series, the network is called a series circuit. Two common examples of series connections include the tying of small pieces of rope together to form a longer rope and the connecting of pipes to get water from one point to another. If the circuit of Fig. 5.4(a) is modiﬁed such that a current-carrying resistor R3 is introduced, as shown in Fig. 5.4(b), the resistors R1 and R2 are no longer in series due to a violation of number 2 of the above def- inition of series elements. The current is the same through series elements. For the circuit of Fig. 5.4(a), therefore, the current I through each resis- tor is the same as that through the battery. The fact that the current is 130  SERIES CIRCUITS S For all one-voltage- source dc circuits E +–I FIG. 5.2 Deﬁning the direction of conventional ﬂow for single-source dc circuits.

A branch of a circuit is any portion of the circuit that has one or more elements in series. In Fig. 5.4(a), the resistor R1 forms one branch of the circuit, the resistor R2 another, and the battery E a third. The total resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the resistance levels. In Fig. 5.4(a), for example, the total resistance (RT) is equal to R1 \u0003 R2. Note that the total resistance is actually the resistance “seen” by the bat- tery as it “looks” into the series combination of elements as shown in Fig. 5.5. In general, to ﬁnd the total resistance of N resistors in series, the fol- lowing equation is applied: (ohms, \u0004) (5.1) Once the total resistance is known, the circuit of Fig. 5.4(a) can be redrawn as shown in Fig. 5.6, clearly revealing that the only resistance the source “sees” is the total resistance. It is totally unaware of how the elements are connected to establish RT. Once RT is known, the current drawn from the source can be determined using Ohm’s law, as follows: (amperes, A) (5.2) Since E is ﬁxed, the magnitude of the source current will be totally dependent on the magnitude of RT. A larger RT will result in a relatively small value of Is, while lesser values of RT will result in increased cur- rent levels. The fact that the current is the same through each element of Fig. 5.4(a) permits a direct calculation of the voltage across each resistor using Ohm’s law; that is, (volts, V) (5.3) The power delivered to each resistor can then be determined using any one of three equations as listed below for R1: (watts, W) (5.4) The power delivered by the source is (watts, W) (5.5) The total power delivered to a resistive circuit is equal to the total power dissipated by the resistive elements.

The net volt- age is determined simply by summing the sources with the same polar- ity and subtracting the total of the sources with the opposite “pressure.” The net polarity is the polarity of the larger sum. In Fig. 5.10(a), for example, the sources are all “pressuring” current to the right, so the net voltage is ET \u0001 E1 \u0003 E2 \u0003 E3 \u0001 10 V \u0003 6 V \u0003 2 V \u0001 18 V as shown in the ﬁgure. In Fig. 5.10(b), however, the greater “pressure” is to the left, with a net voltage of ET \u0001 E2 \u0003 E3 \u0002 E1 \u0001 9 V \u0003 3 V \u0002 4 V \u0001 8 V and the polarity shown in the ﬁgure. 5.4 KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW Note Fig. 5.11. Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of the potential rises and drops around a closed loop (or path) is zero. A closed loop is any continuous path that leaves a point in one direction and returns to that same point from another direction without leaving the circuit. In Fig. 5.12, by following the current, we can trace a continuous path that leaves point a through R1 and returns through E without leaving the circuit. Therefore, abcda is a closed loop. For us to be able to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the summation of poten- tial rises and drops must be made in one direction around the closed loop. For uniformity, the clockwise (CW) direction will be used through- out the text for all applications of Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Be aware, however, that the same result will be obtained if the counterclockwise (CCW) direction is chosen and the law applied correctly. A plus sign is assigned to a potential rise (\u0002 to \u0003), and a minus sign to a potential drop (\u0003 to \u0002). If we follow the current in Fig. 5.12 from point a, we ﬁrst encounter a potential drop V1 (\u0003 to \u0002) across R1 and then another potential drop V2 across R2. Continuing through the volt- age source, we have a potential rise E (\u0002 to \u0003) before returning to point a. In symbolic form, where Σ represents summation, the closed loop, and V the potential drops and rises, we have (Kirchhoff’s voltage law V \u0001 0 in symbolic form) (5.8)\u0007 KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW  133S +– +– +–+– 18 V2 V6 V10 V ETE3E2E1 +– + – + – + – 8 V3 V9 V4 V ETE3E2E1 II I I (a) (b) FIG. 5.10 Reducing series dc voltage sources to a single source.

Kirchhoff’s voltage law can also be stated in the following form: Vrises \u0001 Vdrops (5.9) which in words states that the sum of the rises around a closed loop must equal the sum of the drops in potential. The text will emphasize the use of Eq. (5.8), however. If the loop were taken in the counterclockwise direction starting at point a, the following would result: V \u0001 0 \u0002E \u0003 V2 \u0003 V1 \u0001 0 or, as before, E \u0001 V1 \u0003 V2 The application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law need not follow a path that includes current-carrying elements. For example, in Fig. 5.13 there is a difference in potential between points a and b, even though the two points are not connected by a cur- rent-carrying element. Application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop will result in a difference in potential of 4 V between the two points. That is, using the clockwise direction: \u000312 V \u0002 Vx \u0002 8 V \u0001 0 and Vx \u0001 4 V EXAMPLE 5.4 Determine the unknown voltages for the networks of Fig. 5.14. \u0007 \u0007\u0007 134  SERIES CIRCUITS S FIG. 5.13 Demonstration that a voltage can exist be- tween two points not connected by a current- carrying conductor.

Solution: When applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law, be sure to con- centrate on the polarities of the voltage rise or drop rather than on the type of element. In other words, do not treat a voltage drop across a resistive element differently from a voltage drop across a source. If the polarity dictates that a drop has occurred, that is the important fact when applying the law. In Fig. 5.14(a), for instance, if we choose the clockwise direction, we will ﬁnd that there is a drop across the resistors R1 and R2 and a drop across the source E2. All will therefore have a minus sign when Kirchhoff’s voltage law is applied. Application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit of Fig. 5.14(a) in the clockwise direction will result in \u0003E1 \u0002 V1 \u0002 V2 \u0002 E2 \u0001 0 and V1 \u0001 E1 \u0002 V2 \u0002 E2 \u0001 16 V \u0002 4.2 V \u0002 9 V \u0001 2.8 V The result clearly indicates that there was no need to know the values of the resistors or the current to determine the unknown voltage. Sufﬁ- cient information was carried by the other voltage levels to permit a determination of the unknown. In Fig. 5.14(b) the unknown voltage is not across a current-carrying element. However, as indicated in the paragraphs above, Kirchhoff’s voltage law is not limited to current-carrying elements. In this case there are two possible paths for ﬁnding the unknown. Using the clock- wise path, including the voltage source E, will result in \u0003E \u0002 V1 \u0002 Vx \u0001 0 and Vx \u0001 E \u0002 V1 \u0001 32 V \u0002 12 V \u0001 20 V Using the clockwise direction for the other loop involving R2 and R3 will result in \u0003Vx \u0002 V2 \u0002 V3 \u0001 0 and Vx \u0001 V2 \u0003 V3 \u0001 6 V \u0003 14 V \u0001 20 V matching the result above. EXAMPLE 5.5 Find V1 and V2 for the network of Fig. 5.15. Solution: For path 1, starting at point a in a clockwise direction: \u000325 V \u0002 V1 \u0003 15 V \u0001 0 and V1 \u0001 40 V For path 2, starting at point a in a clockwise direction: \u0002V2 \u0002 20 V \u0001 0 and V2 \u0001 \u000220 V The minus sign simply indicates that the actual polarities of the poten- tial difference are opposite the assumed polarity indicated in Fig. 5.15. The next example will emphasize the fact that when we are applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law, it is the polarities of the voltage rise or drop that are the important parameters, and not the type of element involved.

In such cases, make an assumption about the polarity, and apply Kirch- hoff’s voltage law as before. If the result has a plus sign, the assumed polarity was correct. If it has a minus sign, the magnitude is correct, but the assumed polarity has to be reversed. In this case if we assume a to be positive and b to be negative, an application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the clockwise direction will result in \u00026 V \u0002 14 V \u0002 Vx \u0003 2 V \u0001 0 and Vx \u0001\u000220 V \u0003 2 V \u0001 \u000218 V Since the result is negative, we know that a should be negative and b should be positive, but the magnitude of 18 V is correct.

For example, the voltages across the resistive elements of Fig. 5.23 are provided. The largest resistor of 6 \u0004 captures the bulk of the applied voltage, while the smallest resistor R3 has the least. Note in addition that, since the resistance level of R1 is 6 times that of R3, the voltage across R1 is 6 times that of R3. The fact that the resistance level of R2 is 3 times that of R1 results in three times the voltage across R2. Finally, since R1 is twice R2, the voltage across R1 is twice that of R2. In gen- eral, therefore, the voltage across series resistors will have the same ratio as their resistance levels. It is particularly interesting to note that, if the resistance levels of all the resistors of Fig. 5.23 are increased by the same amount, as shown in Fig. 5.24, the voltage levels will all remain the same. In other words, even though the resistance levels were increased by a factor of 1 mil- lion, the voltage ratios remain the same. Clearly, therefore, it is the ratio of resistor values that counts when it comes to voltage division and not the relative magnitude of all the resistors. The current level of the net- work will be severely affected by the change in resistance level from Fig. 5.23 to Fig. 5.24, but the voltage levels will remain the same. Based on the above, a ﬁrst glance at the series network of Fig. 5.25 should suggest that the major part of the applied voltage will appear across the 1-M\u0004 resistor and very little across the 100-\u0004 resistor. In fact, 1 M\u0004\u0001 (1000)1 k\u0004\u0001 (10,000)100 \u0004, revealing that V1 \u0001 1000V2 \u0001 10,000V3. Solving for the current and then the three voltage levels will result in I \u0001 \u0005 R E T \u0005\u0001 \u0001 99.89 mA and V1 \u0001 IR1 \u0001 (99.89 mA)(1 M\u0004) \u0001 99.89 V V2 \u0001 IR2 \u0001 (99.89 mA)(1 k\u0004) \u0001 99.89 mV \u0001 0.09989 V V3 \u0001 IR3 \u0001 (99.89 mA)(100 \u0004) \u0001 9.989 mV \u0001 0.009989 V clearly substantiating the above conclusions. For the future, therefore, use this approach to estimate the share of the input voltage across series elements to act as a check against the actual calculations or to simply obtain an estimate with a minimum of effort. 100 V\u0005\u0005 1,001,100 \u0004 138  SERIES CIRCUITS S 50 V 4 \u0001 + – 4 \u0001 I 7 \u0001 + – 12.5 V 37.5 V 4 \u0001 + – 4 \u0001 I 7 \u0001V + – V + – FIG. 5.22 Redrawing the circuit of Fig. 5.21. 1 \u0001 + R3 2 V – 3 \u0001 + R2 6 V – 6 \u0001 + R1 12 V – 20 VE FIG. 5.23 Revealing how the voltage will divide across series resistive elements. 20 V 3 M\u0001 6 V + – E R2 6 M\u0001 12 V + – R1 1 M\u0001 2 V + – R3 FIG. 5.24 The ratio of the resistive values determines the voltage division of a series dc circuit. 100 V 1 k\u0001 V2 + – E R2 1 M\u0001 V1 + – R1 100\u0001 V3 + – R3 >> V2 or V3 = 10V3 R1 >> R2 or R3 FIG. 5.25 The largest of the series resistive elements will capture the major share of the applied voltage. In the above discussion the current was determined before the volt- ages of the network were determined. There is, however, a method referred to as the voltage divider rule (VDR) that permits determining the voltage levels without ﬁrst ﬁnding the current. The rule can be derived by analyzing the network of Fig. 5.26.

In words, the voltage divider rule states that the voltage across a resistor in a series circuit is equal to the value of that resistor times the total impressed voltage across the series elements divided by the total resistance of the series elements.

Voltage Sources and Ground Except for a few special cases, electrical and electronic systems are grounded for reference and safety purposes. The symbol for the ground connection appears in Fig. 5.31 with its deﬁned potential level—zero volts. None of the circuits discussed thus far have contained the ground connection. If Fig. 5.4(a) were redrawn with a grounded supply, it might appear as shown in Fig. 5.32(a), (b), or (c). In any case, it is understood that the negative terminal of the battery and the bottom of the resistor R2 are at ground potential. Although Figure 5.32(c) shows NOTATION  141S 0 V FIG. 5.31 Ground potential.

If E \u0001 12 V, then point a is 12 V positive with respect to ground potential, and 12 V exist across the series combination of resistors R1 and R2. If a voltmeter placed from point b to ground reads 4 V, then the voltage across R2 is 4 V, with the higher potential at point b. On large schematics where space is at a premium and clarity is important, voltage sources may be indicated as shown in Figs. 5.33(a) and 5.34(a) rather than as illustrated in Figs. 5.33(b) and 5.34(b). In addition, potential levels may be indicated as in Fig. 5.35, to permit a rapid check of the potential levels at various points in a network with respect to ground to ensure that the system is operating properly. + – + 12 V R2 R1 R2 R1 12 V (a) (b) FIG. 5.33 Replacing the special notation for a dc voltage source with the standard symbol. – 5 V R2 R2 R1 + – 5 V (a) (b) R1 FIG. 5.34 Replacing the notation for a negative dc supply with the standard notation. FIG. 5.35 The expected voltage level at a particular point in a network of the system is functioning properly. Double-Subscript Notation The fact that voltage is an across variable and exists between two points has resulted in a double-subscript notation that deﬁnes the ﬁrst R1 R2 R3 25 V Va 4 \u000110 V 4 VE = 10 V 6 \u0001+ + –– Vb a b subscript as the higher potential. In Fig. 5.36(a), the two points that deﬁne the voltage across the resistor R are denoted by a and b. Since a is the ﬁrst subscript for Vab, point a must have a higher potential than point b if Vab is to have a positive value. If, in fact, point b is at a higher potential than point a, Vab will have a negative value, as indicated in Fig. 5.36(b). 142  SERIES CIRCUITS S + a Vab (Vab = +) R – b (a) I + a Vab (Vab = –) R – b (b) I In summary: The double-subscript notation Vab speciﬁes point a as the higher potential. If this is not the case, a negative sign must be associated with the magnitude of Vab. In other words, the voltage Vab is the voltage at point a with respect to (w.r.t.) point b. Single-Subscript Notation If point b of the notation Vab is speciﬁed as ground potential (zero volts), then a single-subscript notation can be employed that provides the voltage at a point with respect to ground. In Fig. 5.37, Va is the voltage from point a to ground. In this case it is obviously 10 V since it is right across the source voltage E. The volt- age Vb is the voltage from point b to ground. Because it is directly across the 4-\u0004 resistor, Vb \u0001 4 V. In summary: The single-subscript notation Va speciﬁes the voltage at point a with respect to ground (zero volts). If the voltage is less than zero volts, a negative sign must be associated with the magnitude of Va . General Comments A particularly useful relationship can now be established that will have extensive applications in the analysis of electronic circuits. For the above notational standards, the following relationship exists: (5.12) In other words, if the voltage at points a and b is known with respect to ground, then the voltage Vab can be determined using Eq. (5.12). In Fig. 5.37, for example, Vab \u0001 Va \u0002 Vb \u0001 10 V \u0002 4 V \u0001 6 V Vab \u0001 Va \u0002 Vb FIG. 5.36 Deﬁning the sign for double-subscript notation.

The voltage is dropping from a high level of \u000320 V to a negative voltage of \u000215 V. As shown in Fig. 5.41, this represents a drop in voltage of 35 V. In some ways it’s like going from a positive checking balance of $20 to owing $15; the total expenditure is $35. EXAMPLE 5.17 Find the voltages Vb, Vc, and Vac for the network of Fig. 5.42.

Solution: There are two ways to approach this problem. The ﬁrst is to sketch the diagram of Fig. 5.46 and note that there is a 54-V drop across the series resistors R1 and R2.

The equivalent circuit of any source of voltage will therefore appear as shown in Fig. 5.51(b). In this section, we will examine the effect of the internal resistance on the output voltage so that any unexpected changes in terminal characteristics can be explained. In all the circuit analyses to this point, the ideal voltage source (no internal resistance) was used [see Fig. 5.52(a)]. The ideal voltage source has no internal resistance and an output voltage of E volts with no load or full load. In the practical case [Fig. 5.52(b)], where we con- (3 \u0004\u0003 5 \u0004)(10 V)\u0005\u0005 10 \u0004 (2 \u0004)(10 V)\u0005\u0005 2 \u0004\u0003 3 \u0004\u0003 5 \u0004 FIG. 5.50 Example 5.20. sider the effects of the internal resistance, the output voltage will be E volts only when no-load (IL \u0001 0) conditions exist. When a load is con- nected [Fig. 5.52(c)], the output voltage of the voltage source will decrease due to the voltage drop across the internal resistance. By applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the indicated loop of Fig. 5.52(c), we obtain E \u0002 IL Rint \u0002 VL \u0001 0 or, since E \u0001 VNL we have VNL \u0002 IL Rint \u0002 VL \u0001 0 and (5.13) If the value of Rint is not available, it can be found by ﬁrst solving for Rint in the equation just derived for VL; that is, Rint \u0001 \u0005 VNLI \u0002 L VL\u0005 \u0001 \u0005 V I N L L\u0005 \u0002 \u0005 IL I R L L\u0005 and (5.14) A plot of the output voltage versus current appears in Fig. 5.53 for the dc generator having the circuit representation of Fig. 5.51(b). Note that any increase in load demand, starting at any level, causes an addi- tional drop in terminal voltage due to the increasing loss in potential across the internal resistance.

INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF VOLTAGE SOURCES  147S voltage across the internal resistance is Vint \u0001 IFL Rint \u0001 (10 A)(2 \u0004) \u0001 20 V, and the terminal voltage has dropped to 100 V—a signiﬁcant dif- ference when you can ideally expect a 120-V generator to provide the full 120 V if you stay below the listed full-load current. Eventually, if the load current were permitted to increase without limit, the voltage across the internal resistance would equal the supply voltage, and the terminal voltage would be zero. The larger the internal resistance, the steeper is the slope of the characteristics of Fig. 5.53. In fact, for any chosen interval of voltage or current, the magnitude of the internal resistance is given by (5.15) Forthe chosen interval of 5–7 A (DIL \u0001 2A)on Fig. 5.53, DVL is 4V, and Rint \u0001 DVL ⁄DIL \u0001 4V⁄ 2A \u0001 2 \u0004. A direct consequence of the loss in output voltage is a loss in power delivered to the load. Multiplying both sides of Eq. (5.13) by the cur- rent IL in the circuit, we obtain (5.16) EXAMPLE 5.21 Before a load is applied, the terminal voltage of the power supply of Fig. 5.54(a) is set to 40 V. When a load of 500 \u0004 is attached, as shown in Fig. 5.54(b), the terminal voltage drops to 38.5 V. What happened to the remainder of the no-load voltage, and what is the internal resistance of the source? Solution: The difference of 40 V \u0002 38.5 V \u0001 1.5 V now appears across the internal resistance of the source. The load current is 38.5 V/0.5 k\u0004\u0001 77 mA. Applying Eq.

In other words, if a supply is set for 12 V, it is desirable that it maintain this ter- minal voltage, even though the current demand on the supply may vary. A measure of how close a supply will come to ideal conditions is given by the voltage regulation characteristic. By deﬁnition, the voltage reg- ulation (VR) of a supply between the limits of full-load and no-load conditions (Fig. 5.56) is given by the following: (5.17) For ideal conditions, VFL \u0001 VNL and VR% \u0001 0. Therefore, the smaller the voltage regulation, the less the variation in terminal voltage with change in load. It can be shown with a short derivation that the voltage regulation is also given by (5.18) In other words, the smaller the internal resistance for the same load, the smaller the regulation and the more ideal the output.

We now realize that such a condi- tion speciﬁes that ammeters are placed in series with the branch in which the current is to be measured as shown in Fig. 5.57. If the ammeter is to have minimal impact on the behavior of the net- work, its resistance should be very small (ideally zero ohms) compared to the other series elements of the branch such as the resistor R of Fig. 5.57. If the meter resistance approaches or exceeds 10% of R, it will naturally have a signiﬁcant impact on the current level it is measuring. It is also noteworthy that the resistances of the separate current scales of the same meter are usually not the same. In fact, the meter resistance normally increases with decreasing current levels. However, for the majority of situations one can simply assume that the internal ammeter resistance is small enough compared to the other circuit elements that it can be ignored. For an up-scale (analog meter) or positive (digital meter) reading, an ammeter must be connected with current entering the positive terminal of the meter and leaving the negative terminal, as shown in Fig. 5.58. Since most meters employ a red lead for the positive terminal and a black lead for the negative, simply ensure that current enters the red lead and leaves the black one. Voltmeters are always hooked up across the element for which the voltage is to be determined. An up-scale or positive reading on a voltmeter is obtained by being sure that the positive terminal (red lead) is connected to the point of higher potential and the negative terminal (black lead) is connected to the lower potential, as shown in Fig. 5.59. 19.48 \u0004\u0005 500 \u0004 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES  149S R –+I I Rm FIG. 5.57 Series connection of an ammeter. + – I R+– Red lead Black lead I FIG. 5.58 Connecting an ammeter for an up-scale (positive) reading. + – R +– Red lead Black lead V VRI + – + Red lead V E – Black lead FIG. 5.59 Hooking up a voltmeter to obtain an up-scale (positive) reading.

However, the no-load voltage can be measured by simply hooking up the voltmeter as shown in Fig. 5.61(a). Do not be concerned about the apparent path for current that the meter seems to provide by completing the circuit. The internal resistance of the meter is usually sufﬁciently high to ensure that the resulting current is so small that it can be ignored. (Voltmeter loading effects will be dis- cussed in detail in Section 6.9.) An ammeter could then be placed directly across the supply, as shown in Fig. 5.61(b), to measure the short-circuit current ISC and Rint as determined by Ohm’s law: Rint \u0001 ENL /ISC. However, since the internal resistance of the supply may be very low, performing the measurement could result in high current lev- els that could damage the meter and supply and possibly cause danger- ous side effects. The setup of Fig. 5.61(b) is therefore not suggested. A better approach would be to apply a resistive load that will result in a supply current of about half the maximum rated value and measure the terminal voltage. Then use Eq. (5.14).

Although holiday lights can be connected in series or parallel (to be described in the next chapter), the smaller blinking light sets are nor- mally connected in series. It is relatively easy to determine if the lights are connected in series. If one wire enters and leaves the bulb casing, they are in series. If two wires enter and leave, they are probably in par- allel. Normally, when bulbs are connected in series, if one should burn out (the ﬁlament breaks and the circuit opens), all the bulbs will go out since the current path has been interrupted. However, the bulbs of Fig. 5.62(a) are specially designed, as shown in Fig. 5.62(b), to permit cur- rent to continue to ﬂow to the other bulbs when the ﬁlament burns out. At the base of each bulb there is a fuse link wrapped around the two posts holding the ﬁlament. The fuse link of a soft conducting metal appears to be touching the two vertical posts, but in fact a coating on the posts or fuse link prevents conduction from one to the other under normal operating conditions. If a ﬁlament should burn out and create an open circuit between the posts, the current through the bulb and other bulbs would be interrupted if it were not for the fuse link. At the instant a bulb opens up, current through the circuit is zero, and the full 120 V from the outlet will appear across the bad bulb. This high voltage from post to post of a single bulb is of sufﬁcient potential difference to estab- lish current through the insulating coatings and spot-weld the fuse link to the two posts. The circuit is again complete, and all the bulbs will light except the one with the activated fuse link. Keep in mind, how- ever, that each time a bulb burns out, there will be more voltage across the other bulbs of the circuit, making them burn brighter. Eventually, if too many bulbs burn out, the voltage will reach a point where the other bulbs will burn out in rapid succession. The result is that one must replace burned-out bulbs at the earliest opportunity. The bulbs of Fig. 5.62(a) are rated 2.5 V at 0.2 A or 200 mA. Since there are 50 bulbs in series, the total voltage across the bulbs will be 50 \u0006 2.5 V or 125 V which matches the voltage available at the typical APPLICATIONS  151S FIG. 5.62 Holiday lights: (a) 50-unit set; (b) bulb construction.

Since the bulbs are in series, the current through each bulb will be 200 mA. The power rating of each bulb is therefore P \u0001 VI \u0001 (2.5 V)(0.2 A) \u0001 0.5 W with a total wattage demand of 50 \u0006 0.5 W \u0001 25 W. A schematic representation for the set of Fig. 5.62(a) is provided in Fig. 5.63(a). Note that only one ﬂasher unit is required. Since the bulbs are in series, when the ﬂasher unit interrupts the current ﬂow, it will turn off all the bulbs. As shown in Fig. 5.62(b), the ﬂasher unit incor- porates a bimetal thermal switch that will open when heated to a preset level by the current. As soon as it opens, it will begin to cool down and close again so that current can return to the bulbs. It will then heat up again, open up, and repeat the entire process. The result is an on-and- off action that creates the ﬂashing pattern we are so familiar with. Nat- urally, in a colder climate (for example, outside in the snow and ice), it will initially take longer to heat up, so the ﬂashing pattern will be reduced at ﬁrst; but in time as the bulbs warm up, the frequency will increase. The manufacturer speciﬁes that no more than six sets should be con- nected together. The ﬁrst question that then arises is, How can sets be connected together, end to end, without reducing the voltage across each bulb and making all the lights dimmer? If you look closely at the FIG. 5.63 (a) Single-set wiring diagram; (b) special wiring arrangement; (c) redrawn schematic; (d) special plug and ﬂasher unit. +2.5V– 125 V ac Flasher 200 mA 50 bulbs +2.5V–+2.5V–+2.5V–+2.5V–+2.5V– “ ” I = 200 mA 200 mA (a) 125 V ac Plug a b c Three wires Bulbs in series 50 bulbs Connector Plug a b c Establish parallel connection of 50-bulb strings (b) 125 V ac Isupply = 1.2 A 1 A 0.8 A 3(0.2 A) = 0.6 A aaa a bbb cc c c + – 0.2 A 0.2 A 0.2 A 6 sets (c) Isupply (d) wiring, you will ﬁnd that since the bulbs are connected in series, there is one wire to each bulb with additional wires from plug to plug. Why would they need two additional wires if the bulbs are connected in series? The answer lies in the fact that when each set is connected together, they will actually be in parallel (to be discussed in the next chapter) by a unique wiring arrangement shown in Fig. 5.63(b) and redrawn in Fig. 5.63(c) to clearly show the parallel arrangement. Note that the top line is the hot line to all the connected sets, and the bottom line is the return, neutral, or ground line for all the sets. Inside the plug of Fig. 5.63(d) the hot line and return are connected to each set, with the connections to the metal spades of the plug as shown in Fig. 5.63(b). We will ﬁnd in the next chapter that the current drawn from the wall outlet for parallel loads is the sum of the current to each branch. The result, as shown in Fig. 5.63(c), is that the current drawn from the supply is 6 \u0006 200 mA \u0001 1.2 A, and the total wattage for all six sets is the product of the applied voltage and the source cur- rent or (120 V)(1.2 A) \u0001 144 W with 144 W/6 \u0001 24 W per set. Microwave Oven Series circuits can be very effective in the design of safety equipment. Although we all recognize the usefulness of the microwave oven, it can be quite dangerous if the door is not closed or sealed properly. It is not enough to test the closure at only one point around the door because the door may be bent or distorted from continual use, and leakage could result at some point distant from the test point. One common safety arrangement appears in Fig. 5.64. Note that magnetic switches are located all around the door, with the magnet in the door itself and the magnetic door switch in the main frame. Magnetic switches are simply switches where the magnet draws a magnetic conducting bar between two contacts to complete the circuit—somewhat revealed by the symbol APPLICATIONS  153S FIG. 5.64 Series safety switches in a microwave oven. Microwave power unit Magnets Series safety switches Magnets Magnetic door switches for the device in the circuit diagram of Fig. 5.64. Since the magnetic switches are all in series, they must all be closed to complete the circuit and turn on the power unit. If the door is sufﬁciently out of shape to prevent a single magnet from getting close enough to the switching mechanism, the circuit will not be complete, and the power cannot be turned on. Within the control unit of the power supply, either the series circuit completes a circuit for operation or a sensing current is estab- lished and monitored that controls the system operation. Series Alarm Circuit The circuit of Fig. 5.65 is a simple alarm circuit. Note that every ele- ment of the design is in a series conﬁguration. The power supply is a 5-V dc supply that can be provided through a design similar to that of Fig. 2.31, a dc battery, or a combination of an ac and a dc supply that ensures that the battery will always be at full charge. If all the sensors are closed, a current of 5 mA will result because of the terminal load of the relay of about 1 k\u0004. That current energizes the relay and maintains an off position for the alarm. However, if any of the sensors are opened, the current will be interrupted, the relay will let go, and the alarm cir- cuit will be energized. With relatively short wires and a few sensors, the system should work well since the voltage drop across each will be minimal. However, since the alarm wire is usually relatively thin, resulting in a measurable resistance level, if the wire to the sensors is too long, a sufﬁcient voltage drop could occur across the line, reducing the voltage across the relay to a point where the alarm fails to operate properly. Thus, wire length is a factor that must be considered if a series conﬁguration is used. Proper sensitivity to the length of the line should remove any concerns about its operation. An improved design will be described in Chapter 8. 5.12 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice In Section 4.9, the basic procedure for setting up the PSpice folder and running the program were presented. Because of the detail provided in that section, you should review it before proceeding with this example. Because this is only the second example using PSpice, some detail will be provided, but not at the level of Section 4.9. The circuit to be investigated appears in Fig. 5.66. Since the PSpice folder was established in Section 4.9, there is no need to repeat the process here—it is immediately available. Double-clicking on the Orcad Lite Edition icon will generate the Orcad Capture-Lite Edi- tion window. A new project is then initiated by selecting the Create document key at the top left of the screen (it looks like a page with a star in the upper left corner). The result is the New Project dialog box in which SeriesDC is inserted as the Name. The Analog or Mixed A/D is already selected, and C:\\PSpice appears as the Location—only the Name had to be entered! Click OK, and the Create PSpice Project dialog box will appear. Select Create a blank project, click OK, and the working windows will appear. Grabbing the left edge of the SCHEMATIC1:PAGE1 window will allow you to move it to the right so that you can see both screens. Clicking the + sign in the Project Manager window will allow you to set the sequence down to PAGE1. If you prefer to change the name of the SCHEMATIC1, just select it 154  SERIES CIRCUITS S FIG. 5.65 Series alarm circuit. FIG. 5.66 Series dc network to be analyzed using PSpice.

A listing will appear in which Rename is an option; selecting it will result in a Rename Schematic dialog box in which SeriesDC can be entered. In Fig. 5.67 it was left as SCHEMATIC1. Now this next step is important! If the toolbar on the right edge does not appear, be sure to double-click on PAGE1 in the Project Manager window, or select the Schematic Window. When the heading of the Schematic Window is dark blue, the toolbar will appear. To start build- ing the circuit, select Place a part key (the second one down) to obtain the Place Part dialog box. Note that now the SOURCE library is already in place in the Library list from the efforts of Chapter 4; it does not have to be reinstalled. Selecting SOURCE will result in the list of sources under Part List, and VDC can be selected. Click OK, and the cursor can put it in place with a single left click. Right-click and select End Mode to end the process since the network has only one source. One more left click and the source is in place. Now the Place a part keyis selected again, followed by ANALOG library to ﬁnd the resistor R. Once the resistor has been selected, an OK will place it next to the cursor on the screen. This time, since three resistors need to be placed, there is no need to go to End Mode between depositing each. Simply click one in place, then the next, and ﬁnally the third. Then right-click to end the process with End Mode. Finally, a GND must be added by selecting the appro- priate key and selecting 0/SOURCE in the Place Ground dialog box. Click OK, and place the ground as shown in Fig. 5.67. The elements must now be connected using the Place a wire key to obtain the crosshair on the screen. Start at the top of the voltage source with a left click, and draw the wire, left-clicking it at every 90° turn. When a wire is connected from one element to another, move on to the next connection to be made—there is no need to go End Mode between COMPUTER ANALYSIS  155S FIG. 5.67 Applying PSpice to a series dc circuit. 156  SERIES CIRCUITS S connections. Now the labels and values have to be set by double-clicking on each parameter to obtain a Display Properties dialog box. Since the dialog box appears with the quantity of interest in a blue background, sim- ply type in the desired label or value, followed by OK. The network is now complete and ready to be analyzed. Before simulation, select the V, I, and W in the toolbar at the top of the window to ensure that the voltages, currents, and power are dis- played on the screen. To simulate, select the New Simulation Proﬁle key (which appears as a data sheet on the second toolbar down with a star in the top left corner) to obtain the New Simulation dialog box. Enter Bias Point for a dc solution under Name, and hit the Create key. A Simulation Settings-Bias Point dialog box will appear in which Analysis is selected and Bias Point is found under the Analysis type heading. Click OK, and then select the Run PSpice key (the blue arrow) to initiate the simulation. Exit the resulting screen, and the dis- play of Fig. 5.67 will result. The current is clearly 3 A for the circuit with 15 V across R3, and 36 V from a point between R1 and R2 to ground. The voltage across R2 is 36 V \u0002 15 V \u0001 21 V, and the voltage across R1 is 54 V \u0002 36 V \u0001 18 V. The power supplied or dissipated by each element is also listed. There is no question that the results of Fig. 5.67 include a very nice display of voltage, current, and power levels. Electronics Workbench (EWB) Since this is only the second circuit to be constructed using EWB, a detailed list of steps will be included as a review. Essentially, however, the entire circuit of Fig. 5.68 can be “drawn” using simply the con- struction information introduced in Chapter 4. After you have selected the Multisim 2001 icon, a Multisim- Circuit 1 window will appear ready to accept the circuit elements. Select the Sources key at the top of the left toolbar, and a Sources parts bin will appear with 30 options. Selecting the top option will place the GROUND on the screen of Fig. 5.68, and selecting the third option down will result in DC–VOLTAGE–SOURCE. The resistors are obtained by choosing the second key down on the left toolbar called the Basic key. The result is 25 options in which RESISTOR–VIRTUAL is selected. We must return to the RESISTOR–VIRTUAL key to place each resistor on the screen. However, each new resistor is numbered in sequence, although they are all given the default value of 1 k\u0004. Remember from the discussion of Chapter 4 that you should add the meters before connecting the elements together because the meters take space and must be properly oriented. The current will be determined by the XMM1 ammeter and the voltages by XMM2 through XMM5. Of particular importance, note that in EWB the meters are connected in exactly the same way they would be placed in an active circuit in the laboratory. Ammeters are in series with the branch in which the current is to be determined, and voltmeters are connected between the two points of interest (across resistors). In addition, for positive readings, ammeters are connected so that conventional current enters the positive terminal, and voltmeters are connected so that the point of higher potential is connected to the positive terminal. The meter settings are made by double-clicking on the meter symbol on the schematic. In each case, V or I had to be chosen, but the hori- COMPUTER ANALYSIS  157S FIG. 5.68 Applying Electronics Workbench to a series dc circuit. zontal line for dc analysis is the same for each. Again, the Set key can be selected to see what it controls, but the default values of meter input resistance levels will be ﬁne for all the analyses described in this text. Leave the meters on the screen so that the various voltages and the cur- rent level will be displayed after the simulation. Recall from Chapter 4 that elements can be moved by simply clicking on each schematic symbol and dragging it to the desired location. The same is true for labels and values. Labels and values are set by double- clicking on the label or value and entering your preference. Click OK, and they will appear changed on the schematic. There is no need to ﬁrst select a special key to connect the elements. Simply bring the cursor to the starting point to generate the small circle and crosshair. Click on the starting point, and follow the desired path to the next connection path. When in location, click again, and the line will appear. All connecting lines can make 90° turns. However, you cannot follow a diagonal path from one point to another. To remove any element, label, or line, simply click on the quantity to obtain the four-square active status, and select the Delete keyorthe scissors key on the top menu bar. Before simulating, be sure that the Simulate Switch is visible by selecting View-Show Simulate Switch. Then select the 1 option on the switch, and the analysis will begin. The results appearing in Fig. 5.68 verify those obtained using PSpice and the longhand solution. C\u0003\u0003 We will now turn to the C\u0003\u0003 language and review a program designed to perform the same analysis just performed using PSpice and EWB. As noted in earlier chapters, do not expect to understand all the details of how the program was written and why speciﬁc paths were taken. 158  SERIES CIRCUITS S The purpose here is simply to expose the reader to the general charac- teristics of a program using this increasingly popular programming lan- guage. First take note of all the double forward slashes // in the program of Fig. 5.69. They are used to identify comments in the program that will not be recognized by the compiler when the program is run. They can FIG. 5.69 C\u0003\u0003 program designed to perform a complete analysis of the network of Fig. 5.66. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  159S also be used to remind the programmer about speciﬁc objectives to be met at a particular point in the program or the reason for speciﬁc entries. In this example, however, the primary purpose was to enlighten the reader about the purpose of a particular entry or operation. The #include tells the computer to include the ﬁle to follow in the C\u0003\u0003 program. The \biostream.h\t is a header ﬁle that sets up the input-output path between the program and the disk operating system. The class format deﬁnes the data type (in this case all ﬂoating points, which means that a decimal point is included), and the public within the {} reveals that the variables value, voltage, and power are accessible for operations outside the data structure. Note that the main () part of the program extends all the way down to the bottom, as identiﬁed by the braces { }. Within this region all the parameters of the network will be given values, all the calcula- tions will be made, and ﬁnally all the results will be provided. Next, three resistor objects are established. Rtotal is deﬁned as a ﬂoating vari- able, and a voltage source object is introduced. The values of the resis- tors are then entered, and the total resistance is calculated. Next, through cout, the total resistance is printed out using the Rtotal just cal- culated. The \\n” at the end of the cout line calls for a carriage return to prepare for the next cout statement. On the next line, the magnitude of the voltage source is introduced, followed by the calculation of the source current, which is then printed out on the next line. Next the voltage across each resistor is calculated and printed out by the succeeding lines. Finally, the various powers are calculated and printed out. When run, the output will appear as shown in Fig. 5.70 with the same results obtained using PSpice and EWB. As noted above, do not be perplexed by all the details of why certain lines appear as they do. Like everything, with proper instruction and experience, it will all become fairly obvious. Do note, however, that the ﬁrst few lines set up the analysis to be performed by telling the computer the type of opera- tions that need to be handled and the format of the data to be entered and expected. There is then a main part of the program where all the entries, calculations, and outputs are performed. When this program is run, its ﬂow is top-down; that is, one step follows the other without looping back to certain points (an option to be described in a later pro- gram). There was no need to number the lines or to include detailed instructions. If all the comments were removed, the actual program would be quite compact and straightforward, with most of the body of the program being cout statements.

Parallel Circuits 6.1 INTRODUCTION Two network conﬁgurations, series and parallel, form the framework for some of the most complex network structures. A clear understand- ing of each will pay enormous dividends as more complex methods and networks are examined. The series connection was discussed in detail in the last chapter. We will now examine the parallel circuit and all the methods and laws associated with this important conﬁguration. 6.2 PARALLEL ELEMENTS Two elements, branches, or networks are in parallel if they have two points in common. In Fig. 6.1, for example, elements 1 and 2 have terminals a and b in common; they are therefore in parallel. b 1 a 2 FIG. 6.1 Parallel elements. In Fig. 6.2, all the elements are in parallel because they satisfy the above criterion. Three conﬁgurations are provided to demonstrate how the parallel networks can be drawn. Do not let the squaring of the con- 6 P 170  PARALLEL CIRCUITS nection at the top and bottom of Fig. 6.2(a) and (b) cloud the fact that all the elements are connected to one terminal point at the top and bot- tom, as shown in Fig. 6.2(c). In Fig. 6.3, elements 1 and 2 are in parallel because they have ter- minals a and b in common. The parallel combination of 1 and 2 is then in series with element 3 due to the common terminal point b. In Fig. 6.4, elements 1 and 2 are in series due to the common point a, but the series combination of 1 and 2 is in parallel with element 3 as deﬁned by the common terminal connections at b and c. In Figs. 6.1 through 6.4, the numbered boxes were used as a general symbol representing single resistive elements, or batteries, or complex network conﬁgurations. Common examples of parallel elements include the rungs of a lad- der, the tying of more than one rope between two points to increase the strength of the connection, and the use of pipes between two points to split the water between the two points at a ratio determined by the area of the pipes. 6.3 TOTAL CONDUCTANCE AND RESISTANCE Recall that for series resistors, the total resistance is the sum of the resistor values. For parallel elements, the total conductance is the sum of the individual conductances. That is, for the parallel network of Fig. 6.5, we write (6.1) Since increasing levels of conductance will establish higher current levels, the more terms appearing in Eq. (6.1), the higher the input cur- GT \u0001 G1 \u0002 G2 \u0002 G3 \u0002 . . . \u0002 GN P a b (a) a b (b) 1 2 3 1 2 31 2 3 a b (c) FIG. 6.2 Different ways in which three parallel elements may appear. a b 3 2 1 FIG. 6.3 Network in which 1 and 2 are in parallel and 3 is in series with the parallel combination of 1 and 2. a b 1 2 3 c FIG. 6.4 Network in which 1 and 2 are in series and 3 is in parallel with the series combination of 1 and 2. G1 G2 G3 GN GT FIG. 6.5 Determining the total conductance of parallel conductances. TOTAL CONDUCTANCE AND RESISTANCE  171 rent level. In other words, as the number of resistors in parallel increases, the input current level will increase for the same applied volt- age—the opposite effect of increasing the number of resistors in series. Substituting resistor values for the network of Fig. 6.5 will result in the network of Fig. 6.6. Since G \u0001 1/R, the total resistance for the net- work can be determined by direct substitution into Eq. (6.1): P R1 RT R2 R3 FIG. 6.6 Determining the total resistance of parallel resistors. (6.2) Note that the equation is for 1 divided by the total resistance rather than the total resistance. Once the sum of the terms to the right of the equals sign has been determined, it will then be necessary to divide the result into 1 to determine the total resistance. The following examples will demonstrate the additional calculations introduced by the inverse rela- tionship. EXAMPLE 6.1 Determine the total conductance and resistance for the parallel network of Fig. 6.7. Solution: GT \u0001 G1 \u0002 G2 \u0001\u0002\u0001 0.333 S \u0002 0.167 S \u0001 0.5 S and RT \u0001 \u0003 G 1 T \u0003 \u0001\u0001 2 \u0001 EXAMPLE 6.2 Determine the effect on the total conductance and resistance of the network of Fig. 6.7 if another resistor of 10 \u0004 were added in parallel with the other elements.

In addition, the wider the spread in numerical value between two paral- lel resistors, the closer the total resistance will be to the smaller resis- tor. For instance, the total resistance of 3 \u0004 in parallel with 6 \u0004 is 2 \u0004, as demonstrated in Example 6.1. However, the total resistance of 3 \u0004 in parallel with 60 \u0004 is 2.85 \u0004, which is much closer to the value of the smaller resistor. For equal resistors in parallel, the equation becomes signiﬁcantly easier to apply. For N equal resistors in parallel, Equation (6.2) becomes \u0003 R 1 T \u0003 \u0001 \u0003 R 1 \u0003\u0002 \u0003 R 1 \u0003\u0002 \u0003 R 1 \u0003\u0002 . . . \u0002 \u0003 R 1 \u0003 N \u0001 N\u0002\u0003 and (6.3) In other words, the total resistance of N parallel resistors of equal value is the resistance of one resistor divided by the number (N) of parallel elements. For conductance levels, we have (6.4) GT \u0001 NG RT \u0001 \u0003 N R \u0003 1 \u0003 R 1\u0003 0.95 S 1\u0003 5 \u0004 1\u0003 4 \u0004 1\u0003 2 \u0004 1 \u0003 R3 1 \u0003 R2 1 \u0003 R1 P R1 RT R3 5 Ω2 ΩR2 RT R3 = 5 Ω 4 ΩR1 = 2 Ω R2 4 Ω= FIG. 6.8 Example 6.3.

Figure 6.10 is redrawn in Fig. 6.12: RT \u0001\u0001 \u0001 0.5 \u0001 In the vast majority of situations, only two or three parallel resistive elements need to be combined. With this in mind, the following equa- tions were developed to reduce the effects of the inverse relationship when determining RT. For two parallel resistors, we write \u0001\u0002 Multiplying the top and bottom of each term of the right side of the equation by the other resistor will result in \u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0002 \u0002\u0003 \u0001\u0002 \u0001 and (6.5) In words, the total resistance of two parallel resistors is the product of the two divided by their sum. For three parallel resistors, the equation for RT becomes RT \u0001 (6.6a) requiring that we be careful with all the divisions into 1. 1\u0003\u0003 \u0003 R 1 1 \u0003\u0002 \u0003 R 1 2 \u0003\u0002 \u0003 R 1 3 \u0003 RT \u0001 \u0003 R1 R \u0002 1R2 R2 \u0003 R2 \u0002 R1\u0003\u0003 R1R2 R1\u0003 R1R2 R2\u0003 R1R2 1 \u0003 R2 R1\u0003 R1 1 \u0003 R1 R2\u0003 R2 1 \u0003 RT 1 \u0003 R2 1 \u0003 R1 1 \u0003 RT 2 \u0004\u0003 4 R \u0003 N 12 \u0004\u0003 3 R \u0003 N 174  PARALLEL CIRCUITS Equation (6.6a) can also be expanded into the form of Eq.

All the ele- ments have terminals a and b in common. The total resistance is deter- mined by RT \u0001 R1R2 /(R1 \u0002 R2 ), and the source current by Is \u0001 E/RT. Throughout the text, the subscript s will be used to denote a property of the source. Since the terminals of the battery are connected directly across the resistors R1 and R2, the following should be obvious: The voltage across parallel elements is the same. Using this fact will result in V1 \u0001 V2 \u0001 E and I1 \u0001\u0001 with I2 \u0001\u0001 If we take the equation for the total resistance and multiply both sides by the applied voltage, we obtain E\u0002\u0003 \u0001 E\u0002 \u0002 \u0003 and \u0001\u0002 Substituting the Ohm’s law relationships appearing above, we ﬁnd that the source current Is \u0001 I1 \u0002 I2 permitting the following conclusion: For single-source parallel networks, the source current (Is ) is equal to the sum of the individual branch currents.

As shown in Fig. 6.24, the known parameters and quantities of the network are entered ﬁrst, followed by an equation for the unknown resistor R3. Note that after the ﬁrst divi- sion operator was selected, a left bracket was established (to be fol- lowed eventually by a right enclosure bracket) to tell the computer that the mathematical operations in the denominator must be carried out ﬁrst before the division into 1. In addition, each individual division into 1 is separated by brackets to ensure that the division operation is performed before each quantity is added to the neighboring factor. Finally, keep in mind that the Mathcad bracket must encompass each individual expres- sion of the denominator before you place the right bracket in place. 40 V\u0003 20 \u0004 E \u0003 R2 V2\u0003 R2 40 V\u0003 4 \u0004 E \u0003 RT 1\u0003 0.1 S 1 \u0003 R3 1 \u0003 R3 1 \u0003 R3 P FIG. 6.24 Using Mathcad to conﬁrm the results of Example 6.12. 180  PARALLEL CIRCUITS In each case, the quantity of interest was entered below the deﬁning equation to obtain the numerical result by selecting an equal sign.

We now consider Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), which provides an equally important relationship among current levels at any junction. Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering and leaving an area, system, or junction is zero. In other words, the sum of the currents entering an area, system, or junction must equal the sum of the currents leaving the area, system, or junction. In equation form: (6.8) In Fig. 6.25, for instance, the shaded area can enclose an entire sys- tem, a complex network, or simply a junction of two or more paths. In each case the current entering must equal that leaving, as witnessed by the fact that I1 \u0002 I4 \u0001 I2 \u0002 I3 4 A \u0002 8 A \u0001 2 A \u0002 10 A 12 A \u0001 12 A The most common application of the law will be at the junction of two or more paths of current ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 6.26. For some stu- dents it is difﬁcult initially to determine whether a current is entering or leaving a junction. One approach that may help is to picture yourself as standing on the junction and treating the path currents as arrows. If the arrow appears to be heading toward you, as is the case for I1 in Fig. 6.26, then it is entering the junction. If you see the tail of the arrow (from the junction) as it travels down its path away from you, it is leav- ing the junction, as is the case for I2 and I3 in Fig. 6.26.

Simply remember to place all cur- rent levels entering a junction to the left of the equals sign and the sum of all currents leaving a junction to the right of the equals sign. The water-in-the-pipe analogy is an excellent one for supporting and clarifying the preceding law. Quite obviously, the sum total of the water entering a junction must equal the total of the water leaving the exit pipes. In technology the term node is commonly used to refer to a junction of two or more branches. Therefore, this term will be used frequently in the analyses that follow.

The two must be equal since the net current entering any system must equal that leaving. EXAMPLE 6.15 Determine the currents I3 and I5 of Fig. 6.29 through applications of Kirchhoff’s current law. Solution: Note that since node b has two unknown quantities and node a has only one, we must ﬁrst apply Kirchhoff’s current law to node a. The result can then be applied to node b. For node a, I1 \u0002 I2 \u0001 I3 4 A \u0002 3 A \u0001 I3 and I3 \u0001 7 A For node b, I3 \u0001 I4 \u0002 I5 7 A \u0001 1 A \u0002 I5 and I5 \u0001 7 A \u0006 1 A \u0001 6 A EXAMPLE 6.16 Find the magnitude and direction of the currents I3, I4, I6, and I7 for the network of Fig. 6.30. Even though the elements are not in series or parallel, Kirchhoff’s current law can be applied to deter- mine all the unknown currents. Solution: Considering the overall system, we know that the current entering must equal that leaving. Therefore, I7 \u0001 I1 \u0001 10 A Since 10 A are entering node a and 12 A are leaving, I3 must be sup- plying current to the node.

For Example 6.12, we have Is \u0001 I1 \u0002 I2 \u0002 I3 10 A \u0001 4 A \u0002 2 A \u0002 I3 and I3 \u0001 10 A \u0006 6 A \u0001 4 A The application of Kirchhoff’s current law is not limited to networks where all the internal connections are known or visible. For instance, all the currents of the integrated circuit of Fig. 6.31 are known except I1. By treating the system as a single node, we can apply Kirchhoff’s cur- rent law using the following values to ensure an accurate listing of all known quantities: Ii Io 10 mA 5 mA 4 mA 4 mA 8 mA 2 mA 22 mA 6 mA 17 mA Noting the total input current versus that leaving clearly reveals that I1 is a current of 22 mA \u0006 17 mA \u0001 5 mA leaving the system. 6.6 CURRENT DIVIDER RULE As the name suggests, the current divider rule (CDR) will determine how the current entering a set of parallel branches will split between the elements. For two parallel elements of equal value, the current will divide equally. For parallel elements with different values, the smaller the resistance, the greater the share of input current. For parallel elements of different values, the current will split with a ratio equal to the inverse of their resistor values. For example, if one of two parallel resistors is twice the other, then the current through the larger resistor will be half the other. P 5 mA 10 mA 4 mA 4 mA 8 mA2 mA 6 mA I1 20 V IC FIG. 6.31 Integrated circuit. 184  PARALLEL CIRCUITS In Fig. 6.32, since I1 is 1 mA and R1 is six times R3, the current through R3 must be 6 mA (without making any other calculations including the total current or the actual resistance levels). For R2 the current must be 2 mA since R1 is twice R2. The total current must then be the sum of I1, I2, and I3, or 9 mA. In total, therefore, knowing only the current through R1, we were able to ﬁnd all the other currents of the conﬁguration without knowing anything more about the network. P For networks in which only the resistor values are given along with the input current, the current divider rule should be applied to determine the various branch currents. It can be derived using the network of Fig. 6.33. 1 mA R1 6 \u0001 R2 3 \u0001 R3 1 \u0001 IT = 9 mA I3 must be 6 mA ( = 6) R1 R3 I2 must be 2 mA ( = 2) R1 R2 I1 = FIG. 6.32 Demonstrating how current will divide between unequal resistors.

The primary reason for placing two or more batteries in parallel of the same terminal voltage would be to 188  PARALLEL CIRCUITS P increase the current rating (and, therefore, the power rating) of the source. As shown in Fig. 6.40, the current rating of the combination is determined by Is \u0001 I1 \u0002 I2 at the same terminal voltage. The resulting power rating is twice that available with one supply. If two batteries of different terminal voltages were placed in parallel, both would be left ineffective or damaged because the terminal voltage of the larger battery would try to drop rapidly to that of the lower supply. Consider two lead-acid car batteries of different terminal voltage placed in parallel, as shown in Fig. 6.41. The relatively small internal resistances of the batteries are the only current-limiting elements of the resulting series circuit. The current is I \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 120 A which far exceeds the continuous drain rating of the larger supply, resulting in a rapid discharge of E1 and a destructive impact on the smaller supply. 6.8 OPEN AND SHORT CIRCUITS Open circuits and short circuits can often cause more confusion and dif- ﬁculty in the analysis of a system than standard series or parallel con- ﬁgurations. This will become more obvious in the chapters to follow when we apply some of the methods and theorems. An open circuit is simply two isolated terminals not connected by an element of any kind, as shown in Fig. 6.42(a). Since a path for con- duction does not exist, the current associated with an open circuit must always be zero. The voltage across the open circuit, however, can be any value, as determined by the system it is connected to. In summary, therefore, an open circuit can have a potential difference (voltage) across its terminals, but the current is always zero amperes. 6 V\u0003 0.05 \u0004 12 V \u0006 6 V\u0003\u0003 0.03 \u0004\u0002 0.02 \u0004 E1 \u0006 E2\u0003\u0003 Rint1 \u0002 Rint2 I1 12 VE1 E2 E12 V 12 V I2 Is Is = I1 + I2 FIG. 6.40 Parallel voltage sources.

In Fig. 6.43, an open circuit exists between terminals a and b. As shown in the ﬁgure, the voltage across the open-circuit terminals is the supply voltage, but the current is zero due to the absence of a complete circuit. OPEN AND SHORT CIRCUITS  189 A short circuit is a very low resistance, direct connection between two terminals of a network, as shown in Fig. 6.42(b). The current through the short circuit can be any value, as determined by the system it is connected to, but the voltage across the short circuit will always be zero volts because the resistance of the short circuit is assumed to be essentially zero ohms and V \u0001 IR \u0001 I(0 \u0004) \u0001 0 V. In summary, therefore, a short circuit can carry a current of a level determined by the external circuit, but the potential difference (voltage) across its terminals is always zero volts. In Fig. 6.44(a), the current through the 2-\u0004 resistor is 5 A. If a short circuit should develop across the 2-\u0004 resistor, the total resistance of the parallel combination of the 2-\u0004 resistor and the short (of essentially zero ohms) will be 2 \u0004 \u0005\u0005 0 \u0004\u0001 \u0001 0 \u0004, and the current will rise to very high levels, as determined by Ohm’s law: I \u0001\u0001 ∞ A 10 V\u0003 0 \u0004 E \u0003 R (2 \u0004)(0 \u0004)\u0003\u0003 2 \u0004\u0002 0 \u0004 P I = 5 A – + E 2 \u0001R10 V 10-A fuse – + E R10 V RT IR = 0 A I Vshort circuit = 0 V – “Shorted out” Short circuit (a) (b) + FIG. 6.44 Demonstrating the effect of a short circuit on current levels. R1 2 kΩ R2 4 kΩ+ – 20 VE a b + – Vab I FIG. 6.45 Example 6.21. The effect of the 2-\u0004 resistor has effectively been “shorted out” by the low-resistance connection. The maximum current is now limited only by the circuit breaker or fuse in series with the source. For the layperson, the terminology short circuit or open circuit is usually associated with dire situations such as power loss, smoke, or ﬁre. However, in network analysis both can play an integral role in determining speciﬁc parameters about a system. Most often, however, if a short-circuit condition is to be established, it is accomplished with a jumper—a lead of negligible resistance to be connected between the points of interest. Establishing an open circuit simply requires making sure that the terminals of interest are isolated from each other. EXAMPLE 6.21 Determine the voltage Vab for the network of Fig. 6.45. Solution: The open circuit requires that I be zero amperes. The volt- age drop across both resistors is therefore zero volts since V \u0001 IR \u0001 (0)R \u0001 0 V.

Solution: The current through the system is zero amperes due to the open circuit, resulting in a 0-V drop across each resistor. Both resistors can therefore be replaced by short circuits, as shown in Fig. 6.47. The voltage Vab is then directly across the 10-V battery, and Vab \u0001 E1 \u0001 10 V The voltage Vcd requires an application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law: \u0002E1 \u0006 E2 \u0006 Vcd \u0001 0 or Vcd \u0001 E1 \u0006 E2 \u0001 10 V \u0006 30 V \u0001 \u000220 V The negative sign in the solution simply indicates that the actual volt- age Vcd has the opposite polarity of that appearing in Fig. 6.46.

Solution: For the network of Fig. 6.48(a), the current IT will take the path of least resistance, and, since the short-circuit condition at the end of the network is the least-resistance path, all the current will pass through the short circuit. This conclusion can be veriﬁed using Eq. (6.9). The voltage across the network is the same as that across the short circuit and will be zero volts, as shown in Fig. 6.49(a). For the network of Fig. 6.48(b), the open-circuit condition requires that the current be zero amperes. The voltage drops across the resistors VOLTMETERS: LOADING EFFECT  191 must therefore be zero volts, as determined by Ohm’s law [VR \u0001 IR \u0001 (0)R \u0001 0 V], with the resistors simply acting as a connection from the supply to the open circuit. The result is that the open-circuit voltage will be E \u0001 22 V, as shown in Fig. 6.49(b). EXAMPLE 6.24 Calculate the current I and the voltage V for the net- work of Fig. 6.50. Solution: The 10-k\u0004 resistor has been effectively shorted out by the jumper, resulting in the equivalent network of Fig. 6.51.

Solution: The redrawn network appears in Fig. 6.53. The current through the 3-\u0004 resistor is zero due to the open circuit, causing all the current I to pass through the jumper. Since V3Q \u0001 IR \u0001 (0)R \u0001 0 V, the voltage V is directly across the short, and V \u0001 0 V with I \u0001\u0001 \u0001 3 A 6.9 VOLTMETERS: LOADING EFFECT In Chapters 2 and 5, it was noted that voltmeters are always placed across an element to measure the potential difference. We now realize that this connection is synonymous with placing the voltmeter in paral- lel with the element. The insertion of a meter in parallel with a resistor results in a combination of parallel resistors as shown in Fig. 6.54. Since the resistance of two parallel branches is always less than the smaller parallel resistance, the resistance of the voltmeter should be as large as possible (ideally inﬁnite). In Fig. 6.54, a DMM with an inter- nal resistance of 11 M\u0004 is measuring the voltage across a 10-k\u0004 resis- tor. The total resistance of the combination is RT \u0001 10 k\u0004 \u0005\u0005 11 M\u0004\u0001 \u0001 9.99 k\u0004 and we ﬁnd that the network is essentially undisturbed. However, if we use a VOM with an internal resistance of 50 k\u0004 on the 2.5-V scale, the parallel resistance is RT \u0001 10 k\u0004 \u0005\u0005 50 k\u0004\u0001 \u0001 8.33 k\u0004 and the behavior of the network will be altered somewhat since the 10-k\u0004 resistor will now appear to be 8.33 k\u0004 to the rest of the network. The loading of a network by the insertion of meters is not to be taken lightly, especially in research efforts where accuracy is a primary con- sideration. It is good practice always to check the meter resistance level (10 4 \u0004)(50 \b 103 \u0004)\u0003\u0003\u0003 104 \u0004\u0002 (50 \b 10 3 \u0004) (104 \u0004)(11 \b 106 \u0004)\u0003\u0003\u0003 104 \u0004\u0002 (11 \b 10 6 \u0004) 6 V\u0003 2 \u0004 E \u0003 R1 18 V\u0003 5 k\u0004 E \u0003 R1 P – + R1 + V – E 18 V 5 k\u0001 I FIG. 6.51 Network of Fig. 6.50 redrawn.

A factor of 10 between resistance levels will usually provide fairly accurate meter readings for a wide range of applications. Most DMMs have internal resistance levels in excess of 10 M\u0004 on all voltage scales, while the internal resistance of VOMs is sensitive to the chosen scale. To determine the resistance of each scale setting of a VOM in the voltmeter mode, simply multiply the maximum voltage of the scale setting by the ohm/volt (\u0001/V) rating of the meter, normally found at the bottom of the face of the meter. For a typical ohm/volt rating of 20,000, the 2.5-V scale would have an internal resistance of (2.5 V)(20,000 \u0004/V) \u0001 50 k\u0004 whereas for the 100-V scale, it would be (100 V)(20,000 \u0004/V) \u0001 2 M\u0004 and for the 250-V scale, (250 V)(20,000 \u0004/V) \u0001 5 M\u0004 EXAMPLE 6.26 For the relatively simple network of Fig. 6.55: a.

Measurement Techniques For components in series, the placement of ammeters and voltmeters was quite straightforward if a few simple rules were followed. For par- allel circuits, however, some of the measurements can require a little extra care. For any conﬁguration keep in mind that all voltage measure- ments can be made without disturbing the network at all. For ammeters, however, the branch in which the current is to be measured must be opened and the meter inserted. Since the voltage is the same across parallel elements, only one volt- meter will be required as shown in Fig. 6.57. It is a two-point measure- ment, with the negative or black lead connected to the point of lower potential and the positive or red lead to the point of higher potential to 2 M\u0004(20 V)\u0003\u0003 2 M\u0004\u0002 1 M\u0004 11 M\u0004(20 V)\u0003\u0003 11 M\u0004\u0002 1 M\u0004 P Vab + – R 1 M\u0001 + – E 20 V a b FIG. 6.55 Example 6.26. 20 V + – Vab 11 M\u0001 V R 1 M\u0001 E a b FIG. 6.56 Applying a DMM to the circuit of Fig. 6.55. TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES  193P ensure a positive reading. The current through the source can be deter- mined by simply disconnecting the positive terminal of the suply from the network and inserting the ammeter as shown in Fig. 6.57. Note that it is set up to have conventional current enter the positive terminal of the meter and leave the negative terminal. The current through R2 can also be determined quite easily by simply disconnecting the lead from the top of the resistor and inserting the ammeter. Again, it is set up for conventional current to enter the positive terminal for an up-scale reading. Measuring the current through resistor R1 requires a bit more care. It may not initially appear to be that complicated, but the laboratory experience is a clear indication that this measurement can cause some difﬁculties. In general, it simply requires that the connection to the top of resistor R1 be removed as shown in Fig. 6.58(a) to create an open circuit in series with resistor R1. Then the meter is inserted as shown in Fig. 6.58(b), and the correct current reading will be obtained. As a check against any of the ammeter readings, keep in mind that Is \u0001 I1 \u0002 I2, so that if I1 \u0001 Is or I1 \u0001 I2 (for a network with different values of R1 and R2), you should check your readings. Remember also that the ammeter reading will be higher for the smaller resistor of two parallel resistors. 6.10 TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES The art of troubleshooting is not limited solely to electrical or elec- tronic systems. In the broad sense, troubleshooting is a process by which acquired knowledge and experience are employed to localize a problem and offer or implement a solution. There are many reasons why the simplest electrical circuit does not operate correctly. A connection may be open; the measuring instruments may need calibration; the power supply may not be on or may have been connected incorrectly to the circuit; an element may not be performing correctly due to earlier damage or poor manufacturing; a fuse may have blown; and so on. Unfortunately, a deﬁned sequence of steps does not exist for identifying the wide range of problems that can surface in an electrical system. It is only through experience and a clear understand- ing of the basic laws of electric circuits that one can expect to become proﬁcient at quickly locating the cause of an erroneous output. + – V+–A+–A E R2 R1 + – Is I2 + – R2 E = VR1 = VR2 E FIG. 6.57 Setting up meters to measure the voltage and currents of a parallel network. R1+–A R1 I1 Is I2 (b)(a) FIG. 6.58 Measuring current I1 for the network of Fig. 6.57. 194  PARALLEL CIRCUITS It should be fairly obvious, however, that the ﬁrst step in checking a network or identifying a problem area is to have some idea of the expected voltage and current levels. For instance, the circuit of Fig. 6.59 should have a current in the low milliampere range, with the majority of the supply voltage across the 8-k\u0004 resistor. However, as indicated in Fig. 6.59, VR1 \u0001 VR2 \u0001 0V and Va \u0001 20 V. Since V \u0001 IR,the results immediately suggest that I \u0001 0A and an open circuit exists in the circuit. The fact that Va \u0001 20 V immediately tells us that the connections are true from the ground of the supply to point a. The open circuit must therefore exist between R1 and R2 or at the ground connection of R2.An open circuit at either point will result in I \u0001 0A and the readings obtained previously. Keep in mind that, even though I \u0001 0A, R1 does form a connection between the supply and point a. That is, if I \u0001 0A, VR1 \u0001 IR2 \u0001 (0)R2 \u0001 0V,as obtained for a short circuit. In Fig. 6.59, if VR1 \u0001 20 V and VR2 is quite small (\u00010.08 V), it ﬁrst suggests that the circuit is complete, a current does exist, and a problem surrounds the resistor R2. R2 is not shorted out since such a condition would result in VR2 \u0001 0V.A careful check of the inserted resistor reveals that an 8-\u0004 resistor was employed rather than the 8-k\u0004 resistor called for—an incorrect reading of the color code. Perhaps in the future an ohmmeter should be used to check a resistor to validate the color-code reading or to ensure that its value is still in the prescribed range set by the color code. There will be occasions when frustration may develop. You’ve checked all the elements, and all the connections appear tight. The supply is on and set at the proper level; the meters appear to be functioning correctly. In situations such as this, experience becomes a keyfactor. Perhaps you can recall when a recent check of a resistor revealed that the internal connection (not externally visible) was a “make or break” situation or that the resistor was damaged earlier by excessive current levels, so its actual resistance was much lower than called for by the color code. Recheck the supply! Perhaps the termi- nal voltage was set correctly, but the current control knob was left in the zero or minimum position. Is the ground connection stable? The questions that arise may seem endless. However, take heart in the fact that with experience comes an ability to localize problems more rapidly. Of course, the more complicated the system, the longer the list of possibilities, but it is often possible to identify a particular area of the system that is behaving improperly before checking indi- vidual elements. 6.11 APPLICATIONS Car System In Chapter 3, we examined the role of a potentiometer in controlling the light intensity of the panel of a typical automobile. We will now take our analysis a step further and investigate how a number of other ele- ments of the car are connected to the 12-V dc supply. First, it must be understood that the entire electrical system of a car is run as a dc system. Although the generator will produce a varying ac signal, rectiﬁcation will convert it to one having an average dc level for charging the battery. In particular, note the ﬁlter capacitor (Chapter 10) in the alternator branch of Fig. 6.60 to smooth out the rectiﬁed ac wave- P E 20 V R1 2 k\u0001 R2 8 k\u0001 – + Va = 20 V + VR1 = 0 V – a + VR2 = 0 V – I FIG. 6.59 A malfunctioning network. APPLICATIONS  195 form and to provide an improved dc supply. The charged battery must therefore provide the required direct current for the entire electrical sys- tem of the car. Thus, the power demand on the battery at any instant is the product of the terminal voltage and the current drain of the total load of every operating system of the car. This certainly places an enor- mous burden on the battery and its internal chemical reaction and war- rants all the battery care we can provide. Since the electrical system of a car is essentially a parallel system, the total current drain on the battery is the sum of the currents to all the parallel branches of the car connected directly to the battery. In Fig. 6.60 a few branches of the wiring diagram for a car have been sketched to provide some background information on basic wiring, current lev- els, and fuse conﬁgurations. Every automobile has fuse links and fuses, and some also have circuit breakers, to protect the various components of the car and to ensure that a dangerous ﬁre situation does not develop. Except for a few branches that may have series elements, the operating voltage for most components of a car is the terminal voltage of the bat- tery which we will designate as 12 V even though it will typically vary between 12 V and the charging level of 14.6 V. In other words, each component is connected to the battery at one end and to the ground or chassis of the car at the other end. Referring to Fig. 6.60, we ﬁnd that the alternator or charging branch of the system is connected directly across the battery to provide the charging current as indicated. Once the car is started, the rotor of the alternator will turn, generating an ac varying voltage which will then pass through a rectiﬁer network and ﬁlter to provide the dc charging voltage for the battery. Charging will occur only when the sensor, con- nected directly to the battery, signals that the terminal voltage of the battery is too low. Just to the right of the battery the starter branch was included to demonstrate that there is no fusing action between the bat- tery and starter when the ignition switch is activated. The lack of fusing action is provided because enormous starting currents (hundreds of amperes) will ﬂow through the starter to start a car that may not have P FIG. 6.60 Expanded view of an automobile’s electrical system.

The starting level can vary so much that it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right fuse level, and frequent high currents may damage the fuse link and cause a failure at expected levels of current. When the ignition switch is activated, the starting relay will complete the circuit between the battery and starter, and hopefully the car will start. If a car should fail to start, the ﬁrst point of attack should be to check the con- nections at the battery, starting relay, and starter to be sure that they are not providing an unexpected open circuit due to vibration, corrosion, or moisture. Once the car has started, the starting relay will open and the battery can turn its attention to the operating components of the car. Although the diagram of Fig. 6.60 does not display the switching mechanism, the entire electrical network of the car, except for the important external lights, is usually disengaged so that the full strength of the battery can be dedicated to the starting process. The lights are included for situa- tions where turning the lights off, even for short periods of time, could create a dangerous situation. If the car is in a safe environment, it is best to leave the lights off at starting to save the battery an additional 30 A of drain. If the lights are on at starting, a dimming of the lights can be expected due to the starter drain which may exceed 500 A. Today, bat- teries are typically rated in cranking (starting) current rather than ampere-hours. Batteries rated with cold cranking ampere ratings between 700 A and 1000 A are typical today. Separating the alternator from the battery and the battery from the numerous networks of the car are fuse links such as shown in Fig. 6.61(a). They are actually wires of speciﬁc gage designed to open at fairly high current levels of 100 A or more. They are included to protect against those situations where there is an unexpected current drawn from the many circuits it is connected to. That heavy drain can, of course, be from a short circuit in one of the branches, but in such cases the fuse in that branch will probably release. The fuse link is an addi- tional protection for the line if the total current drawn by the parallel- connected branches begins to exceed safe levels. The fuses following the fuse link have the appearance shown in Fig. 6.61(b), where a gap between the legs of the fuse indicates a blown fuse. As shown in Fig. 6.60, the 60-A fuse (often called a power distribution fuse) for the lights is a second-tier fuse sensitive to the total drain from the three light circuits. Finally, the third fuse level is for the individual units of a (a) FIG. 6.61 Car fuses: (a) fuse link; (b) plug-in. (b) 15-A fuse Open APPLICATIONS  197 car such as the lights, air conditioner, and power locks. In each case, the fuse rating exceeds the normal load (current level) of the operating component, but the level of each fuse does give some indication of the demand to be expected under normal operating conditions. For instance, the headlights will typically draw more than 10 A, the tail lights more than 5 A, the air conditioner about 10 A (when the clutch engages), and the power windows 10 A to 20 A depending on how many are operated at once. Some details for only one section of the total car network are pro- vided in Fig. 6.60. In the same ﬁgure, additional parallel paths with their respective fuses have been provided to further reveal the parallel arrangement of all the circuits. In all vehicles made in the United States and in some vehicles made in European countries, the return path to the battery through the ground connection is actually through the chassis of the car. That is, there is only one wire to each electrical load, with the other end simply grounded to the chassis. The return to the battery (chassis to negative terminal) is therefore a heavy-gage wire matching that connected to the positive terminal. In some European cars constructed of a mixture of materials such as metal, plastic, and rubber, the return path through the metallic chassis is lost, and two wires must be connected to each elec- trical load of the car. Parallel Computer Bus Connections The internal construction (hardware) of large mainframe computers and full-size desk models is set up to accept a variety of adapter cards in the slots appearing in Fig. 6.62(a). The primary board (usually the largest), commonly called the motherboard, contains most of the functions required for full computer operation. Adapter cards are normally added to expand the memory, set up a network, add peripheral equipment, and so on. For instance, if you decide to add a modem to your computer, you can simply insert the modem card into the proper channel of Fig. 6.62(a). The bus connectors are connected in parallel with common connections to the power supply, address and data buses, control signals, ground, and so on. For instance, if the bottom connection of each bus connector is a ground connection, that ground connection carries through each bus con- nector and is immediately connected to any adapter card installed. Each card has a slot connector that will ﬁt directly into the bus connector with- out the need for any soldering or construction. The pins of the adapter card are then designed to provide a path between the motherboard and its components to support the desired function. Note in Fig. 6.62(b), which is a back view of the region identiﬁed in Fig. 6.62(a), that if you follow the path of the second pin from the top on the far left, it will be con- nected to the same pin on the other three bus connectors. Most small lap-top computers today have all the options already installed, thereby bypassing the need for bus connectors. Additional memory and other upgrades are added as direct inserts into the mother- board. House Wiring In Chapter 4, the basic power levels of importance were discussed for various services to the home. We are now ready to take the next step and examine the actual connection of elements in the home.

Each parallel branch, however, can have a combination of parallel and series elements. Every full branch of the circuit receives the full 120 V or 208 V, with the current determined by the applied load. Figure 6.63(a) provides the detailed wiring of a single circuit having a light bulb and two outlets. Figure 6.63(b) shows the schematic representation. First note that although each load is in parallel with the supply, switches are always connected in series with the load. The power will get to the lamp only when the switch is closed and the full 120 V appears across the bulb. The connection point for the two outlets is in the ceiling box hold- ing the light bulb. Since a switch is not present, both outlets are always “hot” unless the circuit breaker in the main panel is opened. It is impor- tant that you understand this because you may be tempted to change the light ﬁxture by simply turning off the wall switch.

Note in Fig. 6.63(a) that the feed wire (black) into the ﬁxture from the panel is connected to the switch and both outlets at one point. It is not connected directly to the light ﬁxture because that would put it on all the time. Power to the light ﬁxture is made available through the switch. The con- tinuous connection to the outlets from the panel ensures that the outlets are “hot” whenever the circuit breaker in the panel is on. Note also how the return wire (white) is connected directly to the light switch and out- lets to provide a return for each component. There is no need for the white wire to go through the switch since an applied voltage is a two- point connection and the black wire is controlled by the switch. Proper grounding of the system in total and of the individual loads is one of the most important facets in the installation of any system. There 200  PARALLEL CIRCUITS is a tendency at times to be satisﬁed that the system is working and to pay less attention to proper grounding technique. Always keep in mind that a properly grounded system has a direct path to ground if an undesirable situation should develop. The absence of a direct ground will cause the system to determine its own path to ground, and you could be that path if you happened to touch the wrong wire, metal box, metal pipe, and so on. In Fig. 6.63(a), the connections for the ground wires have been included. Forthe romex (plastic-coated wire) used in Fig. 6.63(a), the ground wire is provided as a bare copper wire. Note that it is connected to the panel which in turn is directly connected to the grounded 8-ft copper rod. In addition, note that the ground connection is carried through the entire cir- cuit, including the switch, light ﬁxture, and outlets. It is one continuous connection. If the outlet box, switch box, and housing for the light ﬁxture are made of a conductive material such as metal, the ground will be con- nected to each. If each is plastic, there is no need for the ground connec- tion. However, the switch, both outlets, and the ﬁxture itself are con- nected to ground. For the switch and outlets there is usually a green screw for the ground wire which is connected to the entire framework of the switch or outlet as shown in Fig. 6.64, including the ground connec- tion of the outlet. For both the switch and the outlet, even the screw or screws used to hold the outside plate in place are grounded since they are screwed into the metal housing of the switch or outlet. When screwed into a metal box, the ground connection can be made by the screws that hold the switch or outlet in the box as shown in Figure 6.64. In any event, always pay strict attention to the grounding process whenever installing any electrical equipment. It is a facet of electrical installation that is often treated too lightly. On the practical side, whenever hooking up a wire to a screw-type terminal, always wrap the wire around the screw in the clockwise man- ner so that when you tighten the screw, it will grab the wire and turn it in the same direction. An expanded view of a typical house-wiring arrangement will appear in Chapter 15. 6.12 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Parallel dc Networks The computer analysis coverage for parallel dc circuits will be very similar to that of series dc circuits. However, in this case the voltage will be the same across all the parallel elements, and the current through each branch will change with the resistance value. The parallel network to be analyzed will have a wide range of resistor values to demonstarate the effect on the resulting current. The following is a list of abbreviations for any parameter of a network when using PSpice: f \u0001 10 \u000615 p \u0001 10 \u000612 n \u0001 10 \u00069 \u0003 \u0001 10 \u00066 m \u0001 10 \u00063 k \u0001 10 \u00023 MEG \u0001 10 \u00026 G \u0001 10 \u00029 T \u0001 10 \u000212 P Continuous-ground bar Ground-wire connection Connected to ground Hot-wire connections Connected to ground Terminal connection for ground of plug Terminal connection for ground of plug FIG. 6.64 Continuous ground connection in a duplex outlet. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  201 In particular, note that m (or M)is used for “milli,” and MEG for “megohms.” Also, PSpice does not distinguish between upper- and lower- case units, but certain parameters typically use either the upper- or lower- case abbreviation as shown above. Since the details of setting up a network and going through the sim- ulation process were covered in detail in Sections 4.9 and 5.12 for dc circuits, the coverage here will be limited solely to the various steps required. These steps should make it obvious that after some exposure, getting to the point where you can ﬁrst “draw” the circuit and run the simulation is pretty quick and direct. After selecting the Create document key (the top left of screen), the following sequence will bring up the Schematic window: ParallelDC- OK-Create a blank project-OK-PAGE1 (if necessary). The voltage source and resistors are introduced as described in detail in earlier sections, but now the resistors need to be turned 90°. You can accomplish this by a right click of the mouse before setting a resistor in place. The resulting long list of options includes Rotate, which if selected will turn the resistor counterclockwise 90°. It can also be rotated by simultaneously selecting Ctrl-R. The resistor can then be placed in position by a left click of the mouse. An additional beneﬁt of this maneuver is that the remaining resistors to be placed will already be in the vertical position. The values selected for the voltage source and resistors appear in Fig. 6.65. Once the network is complete, the simulation and the results of Fig. 6.65 can be obtained through the following sequence: Select New Sim- ulation Proﬁle key-Bias Point-Create-Analysis-Bias Point-OK-Run PSpice key-Exit(x). P FIG. 6.65 Applying PSpice to a parallel network. 202  PARALLEL CIRCUITS The result is Fig. 6.65 which clearly reveals that the voltage is the same across all the parallel elements and the current increases signiﬁ- cantly with decrease in resistance. The range in resistor values suggests, by inspection, that the total resistance will be just less than the smallest resistance of 22 \u0004. Using Ohm’s law and the source current of 2.204 A results in a total resistance of RT \u0001 E/Is \u0001 48 V/2.204 A \u0001 21.78 \u0004, conﬁrming the above conclusion. Electronics Workbench Parallel dc Network For comparison purposes the parallel network of Fig. 6.65 will now be analyzed using Electronics Workbench. The source and ground are selected and placed as shown in Fig. 6.66 us- ing the procedure deﬁned in the previous chapters. For the resistors, VIRTUAL–RESISTOR is chosen, but it must be rotated 90° to match the conﬁguration of Fig. 6.65. You can accomplish this by ﬁrst clicking on the resistor symbol to place it in the active state. Be sure that the resulting small black squares surround the symbol, label, and value; otherwise, you may have activated only the label or value. Then right- click the mouse. The 90 Clockwise can then be selected, and the resis- tor will be turned automatically. Unfortunately, there is no continuum here, so the next resistor will have to be turned using the same proce- dure. The values of each resistor are set by double-clicking on the resis- tor symbol to obtain the Virtual Resistor dialog box. Remember that the unit of measurement is controlled by the scrolls at the right of the unit of measurement. For EWB, unlike PSpice, megohm uses capital M and milliohm uses lowercase m. P FIG. 6.66 Using the indicators of Electronics Workbench to display the currents of a parallel dc network. PROBLEMS  203P This time, rather than using meters to make the measurements, we will use indicators. The Indicators key pad is the tenth down on the left toolbar. It has the appearance of an LCD display with the number 8. Once it has been selected, eight possible indicators will appear. For this example, the A indicator, representing an ammeter, will be used since we are interested only in the curent levels. When A has been selected, a Component Browser will appear with four choices under the Com- ponent Name List; each option refers to a position for the ammeter. The H means “horizontal” as shown in the picture window when the dialog box is ﬁrst opened. The HR means “horizontal,” but with the polarity reversed. The V is for a vertical conﬁguration with the positive sign at the top, and the VR is the vertical position with the positive sign at the bottom. Simply select the one you want followed by an OK, and your choice will appear in that position on the screen. Click it into posi- tion, and you can return for the next indicator. Once all the elements are in place and their values set, simulation can be initiated with the sequence Simulate-Run. The results shown in Fig. 6.66 will appear. Note that all the results appear with the indicator boxes. All are pos- itive results because the ammeters were all entered with a conﬁguration that would result in conventional current entering the positive current. Also note that as was true for inserting the meters, the indicators are placed in series with the branch in which the current is to be measured. PROBLEMS SECTION 6.2 Parallel Elements 1.

Multisource networks are considered in detail in Chapters 8 and 9. In general, series-parallel networks are networks that contain both series and parallel circuit conﬁgurations. One can become proﬁcient in the analysis of series-parallel networks only through exposure, practice, and experience. In time the path to the desired unknown becomes more obvious as one recalls similar conﬁgu- rations and the frustration resulting from choosing the wrong approach. There are a few steps that can be helpful in getting started on the ﬁrst few exercises, although the value of each will become apparent only with experience. General Approach 1. Take a moment to study the problem “in total” and make a brief mental sketch of the overall approach you plan to use. The result may be time- and energy-saving shortcuts. 2. Next examine each region of the network independently before tying them together in series-parallel combinations. This will usually simplify the network and possibly reveal a direct ap- proach toward obtaining one or more desired unknowns. It also eliminates many of the errors that might result due to the lack of a systematic approach. 3. Redraw the network as often as possible with the reduced branches and undisturbed unknown quantities to maintain clarity and provide the reduced networks for the trip back to unknown quantities from the source. Series-Parallel Networks S P P S 214  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS 4. When you have a solution, check that it is reasonable by consid- ering the magnitudes of the energy source and the elements in the network. If it does not seem reasonable, either solve the circuit using another approach or check over your work very carefully. Reduce and Return Approach For many single-source, series-parallel networks, the analysis is one that works back to the source, determines the source current, and then ﬁnds its way to the desired unknown. In Fig. 7.1(a), for instance, the voltage V4 is desired. The absence of a single series or parallel path to V4 from the source immediately reveals that the methods introduced in the last two chapters cannot be applied here. First, series and parallel elements must be combined to establish the reduced circuit of Fig. 7.1(b). Then series elements are combined to form the simplest of con- ﬁgurations in Fig. 7.1(c). The source current can now be determined using Ohm’s law, and we can proceed back through the network as shown in Fig. 7.1(d). The voltage V2 can be determined and then the original network can be redrawn, as shown in Fig. 7.1(e). Since V2 is now known, the voltage divider rule can be used to ﬁnd the desired voltage V4. Because of the similarities between the networks of Figs. 7.1(a) and 7.1(e), and between 7.1(b) and 7.1(d), the networks drawn during the reduction phase are often used for the return path. Although all the details of the analysis were not described above, the general procedure for a number of series-parallel network problems employs the procedure described above: Work back for Is and then fol- low the return path for the speciﬁc unknown. Not every problem will follow this path; some will have simpler, more direct solutions. How- ever, the reduce and return approach will handle one type of problem that does surface over and over again. Block Diagram Approach The block diagram approach will be employed throughout to emphasize the fact that combinations of elements, not simply single resistive ele- ments, can be in series or parallel. The approach will also reveal the number of seemingly different networks that have the same basic struc- ture and therefore can involve similar analysis techniques. Initially, there will be some concern about identifying series and par- allel elements and branches and choosing the best procedure to follow toward a solution. However, as you progress through the examples and try a few problems, a common path toward most solutions will surface that can actually make the analysis of such systems an interesting, enjoyable experience. In Fig. 7.2, blocks B and C are in parallel (points b and c in com- mon), and the voltage source E is in series with block A (point a in common). The parallel combination of B and C is also in series with A and the voltage source E due to the common points b and c, respec- tively. To ensure that the analysis to follow is as clear and uncluttered as possible, the following notation will be used for series and parallel combinations of elements. For series resistors R1 and R2, a comma will be inserted between their subscript notations, as shown here: R1,2 \u0001 R1 \u0002 R2 S P P S (e) R4 R1 + – R3 R2E Is V4 = R4V2 R4 + V3 (d) R1 + – E Is RT′ (c) RTE Is (b) RT′ R1 E Is (a) R4 R1 + – R3 R2E Is V4 Is = E RT V2 + V1 – + – V2 FIG. 7.1 Introducing the reduce and return approach. – + A C a b c E B FIG. 7.2 Introducing the block diagram approach.

Is \u0001\u0001 \u0001 9 mA and, since the source and RA are in series, IA \u0001 Is \u0001 9 mA We can then use the equivalent network of Fig. 7.5 to determine IB and IC using the current divider rule: IB \u0001\u0001 Is \u0001 (9 mA) \u0001 3 mA IC \u0001\u0001 Is \u0001 (9 mA) \u0001 6 mA or, applying Kirchhoff’s current law, IC \u0001 Is \u0005 IB \u0001 9 mA \u0005 3 mA \u0001 6 mA Note that in this solution, we worked back to the source to obtain the source current or total current supplied by the source. The remaining unknowns were then determined by working back through the network to ﬁnd the other unknowns.

The blocks of Fig. 7.2 can be arranged in a variety of ways. In fact, there is no limit on the number of series-parallel conﬁgurations that can appear within a given network. In reverse, the block diagram approach can be used effectively to reduce the apparent complexity of a system by iden- tifying the major series and parallel components of the network. This approach will be demonstrated in the next few examples. 7.2 DESCRIPTIVE EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 7.4 Find the current I4 and the voltage V2 for the network of Fig. 7.10. Solution: In this case, particular unknowns are requested instead of a complete solution. It would, therefore, be a waste of time to ﬁnd all the currents and voltages of the network. The method employed should concentrate on obtaining only the unknowns requested. With the block diagram approach, the network has the basic structure of Fig. 7.11, clearly indicating that the three branches are in parallel and the voltage across A and B is the supply voltage. The current I4 is now immediately obvious as simply the supply voltage divided by the resultant resistance for B. If desired, block A could be broken down further, as shown in Fig. 7.12, to identify C and D as series elements, with the voltage V2 capable of being determined using the voltage divider rule once the resistance of C and D is reduced to a single value. This is an example of how a mental sketch of the approach might be made before applying laws, rules, and so on, to avoid dead ends and growing frustration.

Solution: Again, only speciﬁc unknowns are requested. When the network is redrawn, it will be particularly important to note which unknowns are preserved and which will have to be determined using the original conﬁguration. The block diagram of the network may appear as shown in Fig. 7.14, clearly revealing that A and B are in series. Note in this form the number of unknowns that have been preserved. The volt- age V1 will be the same across the three parallel branches of Fig. 7.13, and V5 will be the same across R4 and R5. The unknown currents I2 and I4 are lost since they represent the currents through only one of the par- allel branches. However, once V1 and V5 are known, the required cur- rents can be found using Ohm’s law. 24 V\u0006 6 (2 \u0004)(12 V)\u0006\u0006 2 \u0004\u0002 4 \u0004 18 \u0004\u0006 9 (3 \u0004)(6 \u0004)\u0006\u0006 3 \u0004\u0002 6 \u0004 12 V\u0006 8 \u0004 E\u0006 R4 S P P S + R1 4 \u0001 I4 R4 8 \u0001R3 6 \u0001R2 3 \u0001 E – 12 V V2 + – FIG. 7.10 Example 7.4.

Find the voltages V1, V3, and Vab for the network of Fig. 7.16. b. Calculate the source current Is. Solutions: This is one of those situations where it might be best to redraw the network before beginning the analysis. Since combining both sources will not affect the unknowns, the network is redrawn as shown in Fig. 7.17, establishing a parallel network with the total source voltage across each parallel branch.

Solution: It would indeed be difﬁcult to analyze the network in the form of Fig. 7.18 with the symbolic notation for the sources and the ref- erence or ground connection in the upper left-hand corner of the dia- gram. However, when the network is redrawn as shown in Fig. 7.19, the unknowns and the relationship between branches become signiﬁcantly clearer.

We are then ready to write the equation for the total resistance and display the result. All the remaining parameters are then deﬁned and displayed as shown. The results are an exact match with the longhand solution. The wonderful thing about Mathcad is that this sequence can be put in memory and called for as the need arises for different networks.

As pointed out in Section 5.8, the application of a load can affect the terminal voltage of the supply. Through a voltage divider network such as the one in Fig. 7.34, a number of terminal voltages can be made available from a single supply. The voltage levels shown (with respect to ground) are determined by a direct application of the voltage divider rule. Figure 7.34 reﬂects a no- load situation due to the absence of any current-drawing elements con- nected between terminals a, b, or c and ground. The larger the resistance level of the applied loads compared to the resistance level of the voltage divider network, the closer the resulting terminal voltage to the no-load levels. In other words, the lower the current demand from a supply, the closer the terminal characteristics are to the no-load levels. FIG. 7.33 Using Mathcad to analyze the ladder network of Fig. 7.27. VOLTAGE DIVIDER SUPPLY (UNLOADED AND LOADED)  227 To demonstrate the validity of the above statement, let us consider the network of Fig. 7.34 with resistive loads that are the average value of the resistive elements of the voltage divider network, as shown in Fig. 7.35. S P P S FIG. 7.35 Voltage divider supply with loads equal to the average value of the resistive elements that make up the supply.

The result is Va \u0001 120 V, which is the same as the no-load level. To determine Vb, we must ﬁrst note that R3 and RL3 are in parallel and R′3 \u0001 R3 \u0003\u0003 RL3 \u0001 30 \u0004 \u0003\u0003 20 \u0004\u0001 12 \u0004.

Applying the voltage divider rule gives Vb \u0001\u0001 66.21 V versus 100 V under no-load conditions. The voltage Vc is Vc \u0001\u0001 24.83 V versus 60 V under no-load conditions. The effect of load resistors close in value to the resistor employed in the voltage divider network is, therefore, to decrease signiﬁcantly some of the terminal voltages. If the load resistors are changed to the 1-k\u0004 level, the terminal volt- ages will all be relatively close to the no-load values. The analysis is similar to the above, with the following results: Va \u0001 120 V Vb \u0001 98.88 V Vc \u0001 58.63 V If we compare current drains established by the applied loads, we ﬁnd for the network of Fig. 7.35 that IL 2 \u0001 \u0006 V R L L 2 2 \u0006 \u0001\u0001 3.31 A and for the 1-k\u0004 level, IL 2 \u0001\u0001 98.88 mA < 0.1 A 98.88 V\u0006 1 k\u0004 66.21 V\u0006 20 \u0004 (12 \u0004)(66.21 V)\u0006\u0006 12 \u0004\u0002 20 \u0004 (12.31 \u0004)(120 V)\u0006\u0006 12.31 \u0004\u0002 10 \u0004 228  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS As noted above in the highlighted statement, the more the current drain, the greater the change in terminal voltage with the application of the load. This is certainly veriﬁed by the fact that IL 2 is about 33.5 times larger with the 20-\u0004 loads. The next example is a design exercise. The voltage and current rat- ings of each load are provided, along with the terminal ratings of the supply. The required voltage divider resistors must be found.

Too often it is assumed that the voltage across a load connected to the wiper arm is determined solely by the potentiometer, and the effect of the load can be ignored. This is deﬁnitely not the case, as is demonstrated in the next few paragraphs. When a load is applied as shown in Fig. 7.38, the output voltage VL is now a function of the magnitude of the load applied since R1 is not as shown in Fig. 7.37 but is instead the parallel combination of R1 and RL. The output voltage is now VL \u0001 with R′ \u0001 R1 \u0003\u0003 RL (7.1) If it is desired to have good control of the output voltage VL through the controlling dial, knob, screw, or whatever, it is advisable to choose a load or potentiometer that satisﬁes the following relationship: (7.2) For example, if we disregard Eq. (7.2) and choose a 1-M\u0004 poten- tiometer with a 100-\u0004 load and set the wiper arm to 1/10 the total resis- tance, as shown in Fig. 7.39, then R′ \u0001 100 k\u0004 \u0003\u0003 100 \u0004\u0001 99.9 \u0004 and VL \u0001 \u0002 0.001 V \u0001 1 mV which is extremely small compared to the expected level of 1 V. In fact, if we move the wiper arm to the midpoint, R′ \u0001 500 k\u0004 \u0003\u0003 100 \u0004\u0001 99.98 \u0004 and VL \u0001 \u0002 0.002 V \u0001 2 mV which is negligible compared to the expected level of 5 V. Even at R1 \u0001 900 k\u0004, VL is simply 0.01 V, or 1/1000 of the available voltage. Using the reverse situation of RT \u0001 100 \u0004 and RL \u0001 1 M\u0004 and the wiper arm at the 1/10 position, as in Fig. 7.40, we ﬁnd R′ \u0001 10 \u0004 \u0001 1 M\u0004 \u0002 10 \u0004 and VL \u0001\u0001 1 V as desired. For the lower limit (worst-case design) of RL \u0001 RT \u0001 100 \u0004, as de- ﬁned by Eq. (7.2) and the halfway position of Fig. 7.38, R′ \u0001 50 \u0004 \u0003\u0003 100 \u0004\u0001 33.33 \u0004 and VL \u0001 \u0002 4 V It may not be the ideal level of 5 V, but at least 40% of the voltage E has been achieved at the halfway position rather than the 0.02% obtained with RL \u0001 100 \u0004 and RT \u0001 1 M\u0004. In general, therefore, try to establish a situation for potentiometer control in which Equation (7.2) is satisﬁed to the highest degree possible. 33.33 \u0004(10 V)\u0006\u0006 33.33 \u0004\u0002 50 \u0004 10 \u0004(10 V)\u0006\u0006 10 \u0004\u0002 90 \u0004 (99.98 \u0004)(10 V)\u0006\u0006 99.98 \u0004\u0002 500 k\u0004 99.9 \u0004(10 V)\u0006\u0006 99.9 \u0004\u0002 900 k\u0004 RL ≥ RT R′E\u0006 R′ \u0002 R2 S P P S R1 E R2 RT VL + – = R1E R1 + R2 FIG. 7.37 Unloaded potentiometer.

A slight variation in the position of the wiper arm will establish the ideal voltage levels across the two loads. 7.6AMMETER, VOLTMETER, AND OHMMETER DESIGN Now that the fundamentals of series, parallel, and series-parallel net- works have been introduced, we are prepared to investigate the funda- mental design of an ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter. Our design of each will employ the d’Arsonval analog movement of Fig. 7.42. The movement consists basically of an iron-core coil mounted on bearings between a permanent magnet. The helical springs limit the turning motion of the coil and provide a path for the current to reach the coil. When a current is passed through the movable coil, the ﬂuxes of the coil and permanent magnet will interact to develop a torque on the coil that will cause it to rotate on its bearings. The movement is adjusted to indicate zero deﬂection on a meter scale when the current through the coil is zero. The direction of current through the coil will then deter- mine whether the pointer will display an up-scale or below-zero indica- tion. For this reason, ammeters and voltmeters have an assigned polar- ity on their terminals to ensure an up-scale reading. D’Arsonval movements are usually rated by current and resistance. The speciﬁcations of a typical movement might be 1 mA, 50 \u0004. The 1 mA is the current sensitivity (CS) of the movement, which is the cur- rent required for a full-scale deﬂection. It will be denoted by the sym- bol ICS. The 50 \u0004 represents the internal resistance (Rm) of the move- ment. A common notation for the movement and its speciﬁcations is provided in Fig. 7.43. 5 k\u0004(120 V)\u0006\u0006 8 k\u0004 3 k\u0004(120 V)\u0006\u0006 8 k\u0004 6 k\u0004(120 V)\u0006\u0006 10 k\u0004 4 k\u0004(120 V)\u0006\u0006 10 k\u0004 S P P S FIG. 7.42 d’Arsonval analog movement.

However, higher currents can be measured if additional circuitry is introduced. This additional circuitry, as shown in Fig. 7.44, results in the basic con- struction of an ammeter. S P P S Rshunt 1 mA, 50 \u0001 b d a c Imax = 1 A Is Im Ammeter FIG. 7.44 Basic ammeter. FIG. 7.45 Multirange ammeter. The resistance Rshunt is chosen for the ammeter of Fig. 7.44 to allow 1 mA to ﬂow through the movement when a maximum current of 1 A enters the ammeter. If less than 1 A should ﬂow through the ammeter, the movement will have less than 1 mA ﬂowing through it and will indicate less than full-scale deﬂection. Since the voltage across parallel elements must be the same, the potential drop across a-b in Fig. 7.44 must equal that across c-d; that is, (1 mA)(50 \u0004) \u0001 Rshunt Is Also, Is must equal 1 A \u0005 1mA \u0001 999 mA if the current is to be limited to 1 mA through the movement (Kirchhoff’s current law).

Most meters employ the same scale for various values of maximum current. If you read 375 on the 0–5 mA scale with the switch on the 5 setting, the cur- rent is 3.75 mA; on the 50 setting, the current is 37.5 mA; and so on. The Voltmeter A variation in the additional circuitry will permit the use of the d’Ar- sonval movement in the design of a voltmeter. The 1-mA, 50-\u0004 move- ment can also be rated as a 50-mV (1 mA \u0007 50 \u0004), 50-\u0004 movement, indicating that the maximum voltage that the movement can measure independently is 50 mV. The millivolt rating is sometimes referred to as the voltage sensitivity (VS). The basic construction of the voltmeter is shown in Fig. 7.46. The Rseries is adjusted to limit the current through the movement to 1mA when the maximum voltage is applied across the voltmeter. A lesser voltage would simply reduce the current in the circuit and thereby the deﬂection of the movement. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop of Fig. 7.46, we obtain [10 V \u0005 (1 mA)(Rseries)] \u0005 50 mV \u0001 0 or Rseries \u0001\u0001 9950 \u0004 In general, (7.4) One method of constructing a multirange voltmeter is shown in Fig. 7.47.

The Ohmmeter In general, ohmmeters are designed to measure resistance in the low, mid-, or high range. The most common is the series ohmmeter, de- signed to read resistance levels in the midrange.

AMMETER, VOLTMETER, AND OHMMETER DESIGN  233 ammeter or voltmeter because it will show a full-scale deﬂection for zero ohms and no deﬂection for inﬁnite resistance. To determine the series resistance Rs, the external terminals are shorted (a direct connection of zero ohms between the two) to simulate zero ohms, and the zero-adjust is set to half its maximum value. The resistance Rs is then adjusted to allow a current equal to the current sen- sitivity of the movement (1 mA) to ﬂow in the circuit. The zero-adjust is set to half its value so that any variation in the components of the meter that may produce a current more or less than the current sensitiv- ity can be compensated for. The current Im is Im (full scale) \u0001 ICS \u0001 (7.5) and (7.6) If an unknown resistance is then placed between the external terminals, the current will be reduced, causing a deﬂection less than full scale. If the terminals are left open, simulating inﬁnite resistance, the pointer will not deﬂect since the current through the circuit is zero. An instrument designed to read very low values of resistance appears in Fig. 7.49. Because of its low-range capability, the network design must be a great deal more sophisticated than described above. It employs electronic components that eliminate the inaccuracies intro- duced by lead and contact resistances. It is similar to the above system in the sense that it is completely portable and does require a dc battery to establish measurement conditions. Special leads are employed to limit any introduced resistance levels. The maximum scale setting can be set as low as 0.00352 (3.52 m\u0004).

Its primary function is to test the insulation found in power transmission systems, electrical machinery, transformers, and so on. To measure the high-resistance values, a high dc voltage is established by a hand-driven generator. If the shaft is rotated above some set value, the output of the generator will be ﬁxed at one selectable voltage, typically 250 V, 500 V, or 1000 V. A photo- graph of a commercially available tester is shown in Fig. 7.50. For this instrument, the range is zero to 5000 M\u0004. 234  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS 7.7GROUNDING Although usually treated too lightly in most introductory electrical or electronics texts, the impact of the ground connection and how it can provide a measure of safety to a design are very important topics. Ground potential is 0 V at every point in a network that has a ground symbol. Since they are all at the same potential, they can all be con- nected together, but for purposes of clarity most are left isolated on a large schematic. On a schematic the voltage levels provided are always with respect to ground. A system can therefore be checked quite rapidly by simply connecting the black lead of the voltmeter to the ground con- nection and placing the red lead at the various points where the typical operating voltage is provided. A close match normally implies that that portion of the system is operating properly. Even though a major part of the discussion to follow includes ac systems, which will not be intro- duced until Chapter 13, the content is such that the background estab- lished thus far will be sufﬁcient to understand the material to be pre- sented. The concept of grounding is one that should be introduced at the earliest opportunity for safety and theoretical reasons. There are various types of grounds depending on the application. An earth ground is one that is connected directly to the earth by a low- impedance connection. The entire surface of the earth is deﬁned to have a potential of 0 V. It is the same at every point because there are sufﬁ- cient conductive agents in the soil such as water and electrolytes to ensure that any difference in voltage on the surface is equalized by a ﬂow of charge between the two points. Every home has an earth ground, usually established by a long conductive rod driven into the ground and connected to the power panel. The electrical code requires a direct connection from earth ground to the cold-water pipes of a home for safety reasons. A “hot” wire touching a cold-water pipe draws suf- ﬁcient current because of the low-impedance ground connection to throw the breaker. Otherwise, people in the bathroom could pick up the voltage when they touch the cold-water faucet, thereby risking bodily harm. Because water is a conductive agent, any area of the home with water such as the bathroom or kitchen is of particular concern. Most electrical systems are connected to earth ground primarily for safety reasons. All the power lines in a laboratory, at industrial locations, or in the home are connected to earth ground. A second type is referred to as a chassis ground, which may be ﬂoat- ing or connected directly to an earth ground. A chassis ground simply stipulates that the chassis has a reference potential for all points of the network. If the chassis is not connected to earth potential (0 V), it is said to be ﬂoating and can have any other reference voltage for the other voltages to be compared to. For instance, if the chassis is sitting at 120 V, all measured voltages of the network will be referenced to this level. A reading of 32 V between a point in the network and the chassis ground will therefore actually be at 152 V with respect to earth poten- tial. Most high-voltage systems are not left ﬂoating, however, because of loss of the safety factor. For instance, if someone should touch the chassis and be standing on a suitable ground, the full 120 V would fall across that individual. Grounding can be particularly important when working with numer- ous pieces of measuring equipment in the laboratory. For instance, the supply and oscilloscope in Fig. 7.51(a) are each connected directly to an earth ground through the negative terminal of each. If the oscillo- S P P S GROUNDING  235 scope is connected as shown in Fig. 7.51(a) to measure the voltage VR1, a dangerous situation will develop. The grounds of each piece of equip- ment are connected together through the earth ground, and they effec- tively short out the resistor. Since the resistor is the primary current- controlling element in the network, the current will rise to a very high level and possibly damage the instruments or cause dangerous side effects. In this case the supply or scope should be used in the ﬂoating mode, or the resistors interchanged as shown in Fig. 7.51(b). In Fig. 7.51(b) the grounds have a common point and do not affect the struc- ture of the network. The National Electrical Code requires that the “hot” (or feeder)line that carries current to a load be black, and the line (called the neutral) that carries the current back to the supply be white. Three-wire conduc- tors have a ground wire that must be green or bare, which will ensure a common ground but which is not designed to carry current. The com- ponents of a three-prong extension cord and wall outlet are shown in Fig. 7.52. Note that on both ﬁxtures the connection to the hot lead is smaller than the return leg and that the ground connection is partially circular. The complete wiring diagram for a household outlet is shown in Fig. 7.53. Note that the current through the ground wire is zero and that both the return wire and the ground wire are connected to an earth ground. The full current to the loads ﬂows through the feeder and return lines.

If a two-wire line were employed as shown in Fig. 7.54(a), the 20-A breaker would be quite comfortable with the 10-A current, and the system would perform nor- mally. However, if abuse to the feeder (or return line) caused it to become frayed and to touch the metal housing of the toaster, the situation depicted in Fig. 7.54(b) would result. The housing would become “hot,” yet the breaker would not “pop” because the current would still be the rated 10 A. A dangerous condition would exist because anyone touching the toaster would feel the full 120 V to ground.

The breaker would “pop,” and the user would be warned that a problem exists. Although the above discussion does not cover all possible areas of concern with proper grounding or introduce all the nuances associated with the effect of grounds on a system’s performance, it should provide an awareness of the importance of understanding its impact. Additional comment on the effects of grounding will be made in the chapters to follow as the need arises. 7.8 APPLICATIONS Boosting a Car Battery Although boosting a car battery may initially appear to be a simple application of parallel networks, it is really a series-parallel operation that is worthy of some investigation. As indicated in Chapter 2, every dc supply has some internal resistance. For the typical 12-V lead-acid car battery, the resistance is quite small—in the milliohm range. In most cases the low internal resistance will ensure that most of the voltage (or power) is delivered to the load and not lost on the internal resistance. In Fig. 7.55, battery #2 has discharged because the lights were left on for three hours during a movie. Fortunately, a friend who made sure his own lights were out has a fully charged battery #1 and a good set of 16-ft cables with #6 gage stranded wire and well-designed clips. The investment in a good set of cables with sufﬁcient length and heavy wire is a wise one, particularly if you live in a cold climate. Flexibility, as provided by stranded wire, is also a very desirable characteristic under some conditions. Be sure to check the gage of the wire and not just the thickness of the insulating jacket. You get what you pay for, and the copper is the most expensive part of the cables. Too often the label says “heavy-duty,” but the wire is too high a gage number. The proper sequence of events in boosting a car is often a function of whom you speak to or what information you read. For safety sake some people recommend that the car with the good battery be turned off when making the connections. This, however, can create an immediate problem if the “dead” battery is in such a bad state that when it is hooked up to the good battery, it will immediately drain it to the point that neither car will start. With this in mind, it does make some sense to leave the car running to ensure that the charging process continues until the starting of the disabled car is initiated. Because accidents do hap- pen, it is strongly recommended that the person making the connections S P P S FIG. 7.55 Boosting a car battery. 12 V 20 mΩ 10 mΩ Booster battery (#1) Down battery (#2) 11.7 V Booster cable Icharging + – 238  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS wear some type of protective eye equipment even if it is just a pair of glasses. Take sufﬁcient time to be sure that you know which are the positive and negative terminals for both cars. If it’s not immediately obvious, keep in mind that the negative or ground side is usually con- nected to the chassis of the car with a relatively short, heavy wire. When you are sure of which are the positive and negative terminals, ﬁrst connect one of the red wire clamps of the booster cables to the pos- itive terminal of the discharged battery—all the while being sure that the other red clamp is not touching the battery or car. Then connect the other end of the red wire to the positive terminal of the fully charged battery. Next, connect one end of the black cable of the booster cables to the negative terminal of the booster battery, and ﬁnally connect the other end of the black cable to the engine block of the stalled vehicle (not the negative post of the dead battery) away from the carburetor, fuel lines, or moving parts of the car. Lastly, have someone maintain a constant idle speed in the car with the good battery as you start the car with the bad battery. After the vehicle starts, remove the cables in the reverse order starting with the cable connected to the engine block. Always be careful to ensure that clamps don’t touch the battery or chas- sis of the car or get near any moving parts. Some people feel that the car with the good battery should charge the bad battery for 10 to 15 min- utes before starting the disabled car so the disabled car will be essen- tially using its own battery in the starting process. Keep in mind that the instant the booster cables are connected, the booster car will be making a concerted effort to charge both its own battery and the drained battery. At starting it will then be asked to supply a heavy current to start the other car. It’s a pretty heavy load to put on a single battery. For the situation of Fig. 7.55, the voltage of battery #2 is less than that of bat- tery #1, and the charging current will ﬂow as shown. The resistance in series with the boosting battery is more because of the long length of the booster cable to the other car. The current is limited only by the series milliohm resistors of the batteries, but the voltage difference is so small that the starting current will be in safe range for the cables involved. The initial charging current will be I \u0001 (12 V \u0005 11.7 V)/ (20 m\u0004 \u0002 10 m\u0004) \u0001 0.3 V/30 m\u0004 \u0001 10 A. At starting, the current lev- els will be as shown in Fig. 7.56 for the resistance levels and battery voltages assumed. At starting, an internal resistance for the starting cir- cuit of 0.1 \u0004 \u0001 100 m\u0004 is assumed. Note that the battery of the dis- abled car has now charged up to 11.8 V with an associated increase in its power level. The presence of two batteries requires that the analysis wait for the methods to be introduced in the next chapter. S P P S FIG. 7.56 Current levels at starting. – + S I1 = 43.75 A 12 V 20 mΩ 10 mΩ I2 = 67.5 A Istarter = I1 + I2 = 111.25 A 100-mΩ starter motor 11.8 V APPLICATIONS  239 S P P S Note also that the current drawn from the starting circuit for the dis- abled car is over 100 A and that the majority of the starting current is provided by the battery being charged. In essence, therefore, the major- ity of the starting current is coming from the disabled car. The good bat- tery has provided an initial charge to the bad battery and has provided the additional current necessary to start the car. But, in total, it is the battery of the disabled car that is the primary source of the starting cur- rent. For this very reason, it is advised to let the charging action con- tinue for 10 or 15 minutes before starting the car. If the disabled car is in really bad shape with a voltage level of only 11 V, the resulting lev- els of current will reverse, with the good battery providing 68.75 A and the bad battery only 37.5 A. Quite obviously, therefore, the worse the condition of the dead battery, the heavier the drain on the good battery. A point can also be reached where the bad battery is in such bad shape that it cannot accept a good charge or provide its share of the starting current. The result can be continuous cranking of the down car without starting, and thus possible damage to the battery of the running car due to the enormous current drain. Once the car is started and the booster cables are removed, the car with the discharged battery will continue to run because the alternator will carry the load (charging the battery and providing the necessary dc voltage) after ignition. The above discussion was all rather straightforward, but let’s inves- tigate what might happen if it is a dark and rainy night, you get rushed, and you hook up the cables incorrectly as shown in Fig. 7.57. The result is two series-aiding batteries and a very low resistance path. The resulting current can then theoretically be extremely high [I \u0001 (12 V \u0002 11.7 V)/30 m\u0004 \u0001 23.7 V/30 m\u0004 \u0001 790 A], perhaps permanently dam- aging the electrical system of both cars and, worst of all, causing an explosion that might seriously injure someone. It is therefore very important that you treat the process of boosting a car with great care. Find that ﬂashlight, double-check the connections, and be sure that everyone is clear when you start that car. Before leaving the subject, we should point out that getting a boost from a tow truck results in a somewhat different situation: The connec- tions to the battery in the truck are very secure; the cable from the truck is a heavy wire with thick insulation; the clamps are also quite large and make an excellent connection with your battery; and the battery is heavy-duty for this type of expected load. The result is less internal resistance on the supply side and a heavier current from the truck bat- tery. In this case, the truck is really starting the disabled car, which sim- ply reacts to the provided surge of power. 12 V 20 mΩ 10 mΩ 11.7 V Booster cable Idamage = 790 A + – – + FIG. 7.57 Current levels if the booster battery is improperly connected. 240  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS S P P S Electronic Circuits The operation of most electronic systems requires a distribution of dc voltages throughout the design. Although a full explanation of why the dc level is required (since it is an ac signal to be ampliﬁed) will have to wait for the introductory courses in electronic circuits, the dc analysis will proceed in much the same manner as described in this chapter. In other words, this chapter and the preceding chapters are sufﬁcient back- ground to perform the dc analysis of the majority of electronic networks you will encounter if given the dc terminal characteristics of the elec- tronic elements. For example, the network of Fig. 7.58 employing a transistor will be covered in detail in any introductory electronics course. The dc voltage between the base (B) of the transistor and the emitter (E) is about 0.7 V under normal operating conditions, and the collector (C) is related to the base current by IC \u0001 bIB \u0001 50IB (b will vary from transistor to transistor). Using these facts will enable us to determine all the dc currents and voltages of the network using simply the laws introduced in this chapter. In general, therefore, be encouraged by the fact that the content of this chapter will ﬁnd numerous applica- tions in the courses to follow. β = 50 VRC RC 2 kΩ + – 220 kΩ + – VRB RB 12 VVBB + – 12 VVCC + – IC IB VBE + – + VCE – C B E FIG. 7.58 dc bias levels of a transistor ampliﬁer.

All the remaining volt- age, current, and power levels for the other elements of the network can now be found using the basic laws applied in this chapter. The above example is typical of the type of exercise you will be asked to perform in your ﬁrst electronics course. It is now necessary for you only to be exposed to the device and to understand the reason for the rela- tionships between the various currents and voltages of the device. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  241 S P P S FIG. 7.59 Using PSpice to verify the results of Example 7.11. 7.9 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Voltage Divider Supply PSpice will now be used to verify the results of Example 7.11. The calculated resistor values will be substi- tuted and the voltage and current levels checked to see if they match the handwritten solution. The network is drawn as described in earlier chapters using only the tools described thus far (see Fig. 7.59)—in one way, a practice exercise for everything learned about the Capture Lite Edition. Note in this case how rotating the ﬁrst resistor sets everything up for the remaining resistors. Further, it is a nice advantage that you can place one resistor after another without going to the End Mode option. Be especially careful with the placement of the ground, and be sure 0/SOURCE is used. Note also that resistor R1 of Fig. 7.59 was entered as 1.333 k\u0001 rather than 1.33 k\u0001 as in the example. When run- ning the program, we found that the computer solutions were not a per- fect match to the longhand solution to the level of accuracy desired unless this change was made. Since all the voltages are to ground, the voltage across RL1 is 60 V; across RL2, 20 V; and across R3, \u000512 V. The currents are also an excel- lent match with the hand solution with IE \u0001 50 mA, IR1 \u0001 30 mA, IR2 \u0001 20 mA, IR3 \u0001 50 mA, IRL2 \u0001 10 mA, and IRL1 \u0001 20 mA. For the display of Fig. 7.59, the W option was disabled to permit concentrating on the voltage and current levels. There is again an exact match with the longhand solution. The program begins with a heading and preprocessor directive. The <iostream.h> header ﬁle sets up the input-output path between the pro- gram and the disk operating system. The main () part of the program, deﬁned by the braces { }, includes all the remaining commands and statements. First, the network parameters and quantities to be determined are deﬁned as ﬂoating-point variables. Next, the cout and cin commands are used to obtain the resistor values and source voltage from the user. The total resistance is then determined in the order described above, fol- lowed by a carriage return “\\n” and a printout of the value. Then the cur- rents are determined and printed out by the last three lines. The program (Fig. 7.61) is quite straightforward and with experience not difﬁcult to write. In addition, consider the beneﬁts of having a pro- gram on ﬁle that can solve any ladder network having the conﬁguration of Fig. 7.60. For the parameter values of Fig. 7.27, the printout will appear as shown in Fig. 7.62, conﬁrming the results of Section 7.3. If an element is missing, simply insert a short-circuit or an open-circuit equivalent, whichever is appropriate. For instance, if R5 and R6 are absent, leaving a two-loop network, simply plug in very large values for R5 and R6 compared to the other elements of the network, and they will appear as open-circuit equivalents in the analysis. This is demonstrated in the run of Fig. 7.63 with a negative supply of 60 V. The results have negative signs for the currents because the deﬁned direction in the pro- gram has the opposite direction. The current I6 is essentially zero amperes, as it should be if R5 and R6 do not exist. If R1, R3, R5, or R6 were the only resistive element to be missing, a short-circuit equivalent would be inserted. If R2 or R4 were the only missing element, the open- circuit equivalent would be substituted. 242  SERIES-PARALLEL NETWORKS C\u0003\u0003 Ladder Network The C\u0002\u0002 program to be introduced will perform a detailed analysis of the network of Fig. 7.60 (appearing as Fig. 7.27 earlier in the text). Once all the parameters are introduced, the program will print out RT , Is, I3, and I6. The order of the program is exactly the same as that of a longhand solution. In Fig. 7.60, Ra \u0001 R5 \u0002 R6 is ﬁrst determined, followed by Rb \u0001 R4 \u0001 Ra and Rc \u0001 R3 \u0002 Rb, with Rd \u0001 R2 \u0001 Rc and RT \u0001 R1 \u0002 Rd.

The step-by-step pro- cedure outlined in those chapters cannot be applied if the sources are not in series or parallel. There will be an interaction of sources that will not permit the reduction technique used in Chapter 7 to ﬁnd quantities such as the total resistance and source current. Methods of analysis have been developed that allow us to approach, in a systematic manner, a network with any number of sources in any arrangement. Fortunately, these methods can also be applied to networks with only one source. The methods to be discussed in detail in this chap- ter include branch-current analysis, mesh analysis, and nodal analy- sis. Each can be applied to the same network. The “best” method cannot be deﬁned by a set of rules but can be determined only by acquiring a ﬁrm understanding of the relative advantages of each. All the methods can be applied to linear bilateral networks. The term linear indicates that the characteristics of the network elements (such as the resistors) are independent of the voltage across or current through them. The second term, bilateral, refers to the fact that there is no change in the behavior or characteristics of an element if the current through or voltage across the element is reversed. Of the three methods listed above, the branch- current method is the only one not restricted to bilateral devices. Before discussing the methods in detail, we shall consider the current source and conversions between voltage and current sources. At the end of the chapter we shall consider bridge networks and D-Y and Y-D conversions. Chapter 9 will present the important theorems of network analysis that can also be employed to solve networks with more than one source. 8.2 CURRENT SOURCES The concept of the current source was introduced in Section 2.4 with the photograph of a commercially available unit. We must now investi- Methods of Analysis and Selected Topics (dc) N A8 256  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (dc) gate its characteristics in greater detail so that we can properly deter- mine its effect on the networks to be examined in this chapter. The current source is often referred to as the dual of the voltage source. A battery supplies a ﬁxed voltage, and the source current can vary; but the current source supplies a ﬁxed current to the branch in which it is located, while its terminal voltage may vary as determined by the network to which it is applied. Note from the above that duality simply implies an interchange of current and voltage to distinguish the characteristics of one source from the other. The interest in the current source is due primarily to semiconductor devices such as the transistor. In the basic electronics courses, you will ﬁnd that the transistor is a current-controlled device. In the physical model (equivalent circuit) of a transistor used in the analysis of transistor networks, there appears a current source as indicated in Fig. 8.1. The sym- bol for a current source appears in Fig. 8.1(a). The direction of the arrow within the circle indicates the direction in which current is being supplied. NA For further comparison, the terminal characteristics of an ideal dc voltage and current source are presented in Fig. 8.2, ideal implying per- fect sources, or no internal losses sensitive to the demand from the applied load. Note that for the voltage source, the terminal voltage is ﬁxed at E volts independent of the direction of the current I. The direc- tion and magnitude of I will be determined by the network to which the supply is connected. FIG. 8.1 Current source within the transistor equivalent circuit.

Voltage E I E 0 I (a) Current Vs I I 0 (b) Vs (+) – (–) + I The characteristics of the ideal current source, shown in Fig. 8.2(b), reveal that the magnitude of the supply current is independent of the polarity of the voltage across the source. The polarity and magnitude of the source voltage Vs will be determined by the network to which the source is connected. For all one-voltage-source networks the current will have the direc- tion indicated to the right of the battery in Fig. 8.2(a). For all single- SOURCE CONVERSIONS  257 current-source networks, it will have the polarity indicated to the right of the current source in Fig. 8.2(b). In review: A current source determines the current in the branch in which it is located and the magnitude and polarity of the voltage across a current source are a function of the network to which it is applied.

For the voltage source, if Rs \u0001 0 \u0002 or is so small compared to any series resistor that it can be ignored, then we have an “ideal” voltage source. For the current source, if Rs \u0001 ∞ \u0002 or is large enough compared to other parallel ele- ments that it can be ignored, then we have an “ideal” current source. If the internal resistance is included with either source, then that source can be converted to the other type using the procedure to be described in this section. Since it is often advantageous to make such a maneuver, this entire section is devoted to being sure that the steps are understood. It is important to realize, however, as we proceed through this section, that source conversions are equivalent only at their external terminals. The internal characteristics of each are quite different. We want the equivalence to ensure that the applied load of Figs. 8.6 and 8.7 will receive the same current, voltage, and power from each source and in effect not know, or care, which source is present. In Fig. 8.6 if we solve for the load current IL, we obtain IL \u0001 \u0003 Rs \u0004 E RL \u0003 (8.1) If we multiply this by a factor of 1, which we can choose to be Rs /Rs, we obtain IL \u0001 \u0003 Rs (1 \u0004 )E RL \u0003 \u0001 \u0003 ( R R s s\u0004 /Rs R )E L \u0003 \u0001 \u0003 R R s s ( \u0004 E/R R s L )\u0003 \u0001 \u0003 Rs R \u0004 s I RL \u0003 (8.2) If we deﬁne I \u0001 E/Rs, Equation (8.2) is the same as that obtained by applying the current divider rule to the network of Fig. 8.7. The result is an equivalence between the networks of Figs. 8.6 and 8.7 that simply requires that I \u0001 E/Rs and the series resistor Rs of Fig. 8.6 be placed in parallel, as in Fig. 8.7. The validity of this is demonstrated in Example 8.4 of this section. For clarity, the equivalent sources, as far as terminals a and b are con- cerned, are repeated in Fig. 8.8 with the equations for converting in either direction. Note, as just indicated, that the resistor Rs is the same in each source; only its position changes. The current of the current source or the voltage of the voltage source is determined using Ohm’s law and the parameters of the other conﬁguration. It was pointed out in some detail in Chapter 6 that every source of voltage has some internal series resistance. Forthe current source, some internal parallel resistance will always exist in the practical world. However, in many cases, it is an NA Rs RL IL E Rs RL IL E RsI = FIG. 8.6 Practical voltage source.

SOURCE CONVERSIONS  259 excellent approximation to drop the internal resistance of a source due to the magnitude of the elements of the network to which it is applied. For this reason, in the analyses to follow, voltage sources may appear with- out a series resistor, and current sources may appear without a parallel resistance. Realize, however, that for us to perform a conversion from one type of source to another, a voltage source must have a resistor in series with it, and a current source must have a resistor in parallel. EXAMPLE 8.4 a. Convert the voltage source of Fig. 8.9(a) to a current source, and cal- culate the current through the 4-\u0002 load for each source. b.

For the situation indicated at point a in Fig. 8.18, we ﬁnd by application of Kirchhoff’s current law that the current leaving that point is greater than that entering—an impossible situation. Therefore, current sources of different current ratings are not connected in series, just as voltage sources of different voltage ratings are not connected in parallel. 8.6 BRANCH-CURRENT ANALYSIS We will now consider the ﬁrst in a series of methods for solving net- works with two or more sources.

Keep in mind that networks with two isolated voltage sources cannot be solved using the approach of Chapter 7. For additional evi- dence of this fact, try solving for the unknown elements of Example 8.9 using the methods introduced in Chapter 7. The network of Fig. 8.21 can be solved using the source conversions described in the last section, but the method to be described in this section has applications far beyond the conﬁguration of this network. The most direct introduction to a method of this type is to list the series of steps required for its application. There are four steps, as indicated below. Before continuing, understand that this method will produce the current through each branch of the network, the branch current. Once this is known, all other quantities, such as voltage or power, can be determined. 1. Assign a distinct current of arbitrary direction to each branch of the network. 2. Indicate the polarities for each resistor as determined by the assumed current direction. 3. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed, independent loop of the network. The best way to determine how many times Kirchhoff’s voltage law will have to be applied is to determine the number of “windows” in the network. The network of Example 8.9 has a deﬁnite similarity to the two-window conﬁguration of Fig. 8.19(a). The result is a need to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law twice. For networks with three windows, as shown in Fig. 8.19(b), three applications of Kirchhoff’s voltage law are required, and so on. NA 4. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at the minimum number of nodes that will include all the branch currents of the network. The minimum number is one less than the number of independent nodes of the network. For the purposes of this analysis, a node is a junction of two or more branches, where a branch is any combination FIG. 8.19 Determining the number of independent closed loops.

The current directions for I1 and I2 were chosen to match the “pressure” applied by sources E1 and E2, respectively. Since both I1 and I2 enter node a, I3 is leaving.

The currents I1, I2, and I3 are the actual currents in the branches in which they were deﬁned. A negative sign in the solution simply reveals that the actual current has the opposite direction than initially deﬁned—the magnitude is correct. Once the actual current directions and their magnitudes are inserted in the original network, the various voltages and power levels can be determined. For this example, the actual current directions and their magnitudes have been entered on the original network in Fig. 8.24. Note that the current through the series elements R1 and E1 is 1 A; the current through R3, 1 A; and the current through the series elements R2 and E2, 2 A. Due to the minus sign in the solution, the direction of I1 is opposite to that shown in Fig. 8.21. The voltage across any resistor can now be found using Ohm’s law, and the power delivered by either source or to any one of the three resistors can be found using the appropriate power equation.

The term mesh is derived from the similarities in appearance between the closed loops of a network and a wire mesh fence. Although this approach is on a more sophisticated plane than the branch-current method, it incorporates many of the ideas just developed. Of the two methods, mesh analysis is the one more frequently applied today. Branch-current analysis is introduced as a stepping stone to mesh analysis because branch currents are initially more “real” to the student than the mesh (loop) currents employed in mesh analysis.

It is now accomplished in the initial writing of the equations. The systematic approach outlined below should be fol- lowed when applying this method. 1. Assign a distinct current in the clockwise direction to each independent, closed loop of the network. It is not absolutely necessary to choose the clockwise direction for each loop current. In fact, any direction can be chosen for each loop current with no loss in accuracy, as long as the remaining steps are followed properly. However, by choosing the clockwise direction as a standard, we can develop a shorthand method (Section 8.8) for writing the required equations that will save time and possibly prevent some common errors. This ﬁrst step is accomplished most effectively by placing a loop current within each “window” of the network, as demonstrated in the previous section, to ensure that they are all independent. A variety of other loop currents can be assigned. In each case, however, be sure that the information carried by any one loop equation is not included in a combination of the other network equations. This is the crux of the ter- minology: independent. No matter how you choose your loop currents, the number of loop currents required is always equal to the number of windows of a planar (no-crossovers) network. On occasion a network may appear to be nonplanar. However, a redrawing of the network may reveal that it is, in fact, planar. Such may be the case in one or two problems at the end of the chapter. Before continuing to the next step, let us ensure that the concept of a loop current is clear. For the network of Fig. 8.26, the loop current I1 is the branch current of the branch containing the 2-\u0002 resistor and 2-V battery. The current through the 4-\u0002 resistor is not I1, however, since there is also a loop current I2 through it. Since they have opposite direc- tions, I4\u0002 equals the difference between the two, I1 \u0005 I2 or I2 \u0005 I1, depending on which you choose to be the deﬁning direction. In other words, a loop current is a branch current only when it is the only loop current assigned to that branch. 2. Indicate the polarities within each loop for each resistor as determined by the assumed direction of loop current for that loop. Note the requirement that the polarities be placed within each loop. This requires, as shown in Fig. 8.26, that the 4-\u0001 resistor have two sets of polarities across it. 3. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop in the clockwise direction. Again, the clockwise direction was chosen to establish uniformity and prepare us for the method to be introduced in the next section. a. If a resistor has two or more assumed currents through it, the total current through the resistor is the assumed current of the loop in which Kirchhoff’s voltage law is being applied, plus the assumed currents of the other loops passing through in the same direction, minus the assumed currents through in the opposite direction. b. The polarity of a voltage source is unaffected by the direction of the assigned loop currents. 4. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations for the assumed loop currents.

Solution: Step 1: Two loop currents (I1 and I2) are assigned in the clockwise direction in the windows of the network. A third loop (I3) could have been included around the entire network, but the information carried by this loop is already included in the other two. Step 2: Polarities are drawn within each window to agree with assumed current directions. Note that for this case, the polarities across the 4-\u0002 resistor are the opposite for each loop current. Step 3: Kirchhoff’s voltage law is applied around each loop in the clockwise direction. Keep in mind as this step is performed that the law is concerned only with the magnitude and polarity of the voltages around the closed loop and not with whether a voltage rise or drop is due to a battery or a resistive element. The voltage across each resistor is determined by V \u0001 IR, and for a resistor with more than one current through it, the current is the loop current of the loop being examined plus or minus the other loop currents as determined by their directions. If clockwise applications of Kirchhoff’s voltage law are always chosen, the other loop currents will always be subtracted from the loop current of the loop being analyzed. loop 1: \u0004E1 \u0005 V1 \u0005 V3 \u0001 0 (clockwise starting at point a) loop 2: \u0005V3 \u0005 V2 \u0005 E2 \u0001 0 (clockwise starting at point b) \u0005(4 \u0002)(I2 \u0005 I1) \u0005 (1 \u0002)I2 \u0005 6 V \u0001 0 Step 4: The equations are then rewritten as follows (without units for clarity): loop 1: \u00042 \u0005 2I1 \u0005 4I1 \u0004 4I2 \u0001 0 loop 2: \u00054I2 \u0004 4I1 \u0005 1I2 \u0005 6 \u0001 0 and loop 1: \u00042 \u0005 6I1 \u0004 4I2 \u0001 0 loop 2: \u00055I2 \u0004 4I1 \u0005 6 \u0001 0 or loop 1: \u00056I1 \u0004 4I2 \u0001\u00052 loop 2: \u00044I1 \u0005 5I2 \u0001\u00046 Applying determinants will result in I1 \u0001 \u00021 A and I2 \u0001 \u00022 A The minus signs indicate that the currents have a direction opposite to that indicated by the assumed loop current. The actual current through the 2-V source and 2-\u0002 resistor is there- fore 1 A in the other direction, and the current through the 6-V source and 1-\u0002 resistor is 2 A in the opposite direction indicated on the circuit. The current through the 4-\u0002 resistor is determined by the following equation from the original network: \u00042 V \u0005 2 \u0002 I1 \u0005 4 \u0002 I 1 \u0005 I2 \u0001 0 Total current through 4-\u0002 resistor Voltage drop across 4-\u0002 resistor Subtracted since I2 is opposite in direction to I 1.

Supermesh Currents On occasion there will be current sources in the network to which mesh analysis is to be applied. In such cases one can convert the current source to a voltage source (if a parallel resistor is present) and proceed as before or utilize a supermesh current and proceed as follows. Start as before and assign a mesh current to each independent loop, including the current sources, as if they were resistors or voltage sources.

As an aid in introducing the pro- cedure, the network of Example 8.12 (Fig. 8.27) has been redrawn in Fig. 8.35 with the assigned loop currents. (Note that each loop current has a clockwise direction.) The equations obtained are \u00057I1 \u0004 6I2 \u0001 5 6I1 \u0005 8I2 \u0001\u000510 which can also be written as 7I1 \u0005 6I2 \u0001\u00055 8I2 \u0005 6I1 \u0001 10 and expanded as Col. 1 Col. 2 Col. 3 (1 \u0004 6)I1 \u0005 6I2 \u0001 (5 \u0005 10) (2 \u0004 6)I2 \u0005 6I1 \u0001 10 Note in the above equations that column 1 is composed of a loop current times the sum of the resistors through which that loop current passes. Column 2 is the product of the resistors common to another loop current times that other loop current. Note that in each equation, this column is subtracted from column 1. Column 3 is the algebraic sum of the voltage sources through which the loop current of interest passes. A source is assigned a positive sign if the loop current passes from the negative to the positive terminal, and a negative value is assigned if the polarities are reversed. The comments above are correct only for a standard direction of loop current in each window, the one chosen being the clockwise direction. The above statements can be extended to develop the following for- mat approach to mesh analysis: 76 A\u0003 16 I1 I2 21 2 \u0001R3 + – – R1 + 1 \u0001 R2 6 \u0001 + – – + 5 VE1 – + 10 VE2 – + FIG. 8.35 Network of Fig. 8.27 redrawn with assigned loop currents. MESH ANALYSIS (FORMAT APPROACH)  275 1. Assign a loop current to each independent, closed loop (as in the previous section) in a clockwise direction. 2. The number of required equations is equal to the number of chosen independent, closed loops. Column 1 of each equation is formed by summing the resistance values of those resistors through which the loop current of interest passes and multiplying the result by that loop current. 3. We must now consider the mutual terms, which, as noted in the examples above, are always subtracted from the ﬁrst column. A mutual term is simply any resistive element having an additional loop current passing through it. It is possible to have more than one mutual term if the loop current of interest has an element in common with more than one other loop current. This will be demonstrated in an example to follow. Each term is the product of the mutual resistor and the other loop current passing through the same element. 4. The column to the right of the equality sign is the algebraic sum of the voltage sources through which the loop current of interest passes. Positive signs are assigned to those sources of voltage having a polarity such that the loop current passes from the negative to the positive terminal. A negative sign is assigned to those potentials for which the reverse is true. 5. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations for the desired loop currents. Before considering a few examples, be aware that since the column to the right of the equals sign is the algebraic sum of the voltage sources in that loop, the format approach can be applied only to networks in which all current sources have been converted to their equivalent volt- age source. EXAMPLE 8.16 Write the mesh equations for the network of Fig. 8.36, and ﬁnd the current through the 7-\u0002 resistor.

As shown in Fig. 8.39, a Guess value for each variable must ﬁrst be deﬁned. Such guessing helps the com- puter begin its iteration process as it searches for the solution. By pro- viding a rough estimate of 1, the computer recognizes that the result will probably be a number with a magnitude less than 100 rather than have to worry about solutions that extend into the thousands or tens of thousands—the search has been narrowed considerably. Next, as shown, the word Given must be entered to tell the computer that the deﬁning equations will follow. Finally, each equation must be carefully entered and set equal to the constant on the right using the Ctrl\u0004 operation. The results are then obtained with the Find(I1,I2,I3) expression and an equal sign. As shown, the results are available with an acceptable degree of accuracy even though entering the equations and performing the analysis took only a minute or two (with practice).

We will now employ Kirchhoff’s current law to develop a method referred to as nodal analysis. A node is deﬁned as a junction of two or more branches. If we now deﬁne one node of any network as a reference (that is, a point of zero potential or ground), the remaining nodes of the network will all have a ﬁxed potential relative to this reference. For a network of N nodes, therefore, there will exist (N \u00051) nodes with a ﬁxed potential relative to the assigned reference node. Equations relating these nodal voltages can be written by applying Kirchhoff’s current law at each of the (N \u00051) nodes. To obtain the complete solution of a network, these nodal volt- ages are then evaluated in the same manner in which loop currents were found in loop analysis. NODAL ANALYSIS (GENERAL APPROACH)  279 NA The nodal analysis method is applied as follows: 1. Determine the number of nodes within the network. 2. Pick a reference node, and label each remaining node with a subscripted value of voltage: V1, V2, and so on. 3. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each node except the reference. Assume that all unknown currents leave the node for each application of Kirchhoff’s current law. In other words, for each node, don’t be inﬂuenced by the direction that an unknown current for another node may have had. Each node is to be treated as a separate entity, independent of the application of Kirchhoff’s current law to the other nodes. 4. Solve the resulting equations for the nodal voltages. A few examples will clarify the procedure deﬁned by step 3. It will initially take some practice writing the equations for Kirchhoff’s cur- rent law correctly, but in time the advantage of assuming that all the currents leave a node rather than identifying a speciﬁc direction for each branch will become obvious. (The same type of advantage is asso- ciated with assuming that all the mesh currents are clockwise when applying mesh analysis.) EXAMPLE 8.19 Apply nodal analysis to the network of Fig. 8.40. Solution: Steps 1 and 2: The network has two nodes, as shown in Fig. 8.41. The lower node is deﬁned as the reference node at ground potential (zero volts), and the other node as V1, the voltage from node 1 to ground. Step 3: I1 and I2 are deﬁned as leaving the node in Fig. 8.42, and Kirch- hoff’s current law is applied as follows: I \u0001 I1 \u0004 I2 The current I2 is related to the nodal voltage V1 by Ohm’s law: I2 \u0001\u0001 The current I1 is also determined by Ohm’s law as follows: I1 \u0001 with VR1 \u0001 V1 \u0005 E Substituting into the Kirchhoff’s current law equation: I \u0001\u0004 and rearranging, we have I \u0001\u0005\u0004\u0001 V1\u0004 \u0004 \u0005 \u0005 or V1\u0004 \u0004 \u0005 \u0001\u0004 I E \u0003 R1 1 \u0003 R2 1 \u0003 R1 E \u0003 R1 1 \u0003 R2 1 \u0003 R1 V1\u0003 R2 E \u0003 R1 V1\u0003 R1 V1\u0003 R2 V1 \u0005 E\u0003 R1 VR1\u0003 R1 V1 \u0003 R2 VR2\u0003 R2 I 1 A12 \u0001R2 R1 6 \u0001 E 24 V – + FIG. 8.40 Example 8.19.

In such cases we can convert the voltage source to a current source (if a series resistor is present) and pro- ceed as before, or we can introduce the concept of a supernode and pro- ceed as follows. Start as before and assign a nodal voltage to each independent node of the network, including each independent voltage source as if it were a resistor or current source. Then mentally replace the independent voltage sources with short-circuit equivalents, and apply Kirchhoff’s current law to the deﬁned nodes of the network. Any node including the effect of ele- ments tied only to other nodes is referred to as a supernode (since it has an additional number of terms). Finally, relate the deﬁned nodes to the independent voltage sources of the network, and solve for the nodal volt- ages. The next example will clarify the deﬁnition of supernode.

The result is a single supernode for which Kirchhoff’s current law must be applied. Be sure to leave the other deﬁned nodes in place and use them to deﬁne the currents from that region of the network. In particular, note that the current I3 will leave the supernode at V1 and then enter the same supernode at V2.It must therefore appear twice when applying Kirchhoff’s current law, as shown below: Σ Ii \u0001 Σ Io 6 A \u0004 I3 \u0001 I1 \u0004 I2 \u0004 4 A \u0004 I3 or I1 \u0004 I2 \u0001 6 A \u0005 4 A \u0001 2 A Then \u0004\u0001 2 A and \u0004\u0001 2 A Relating the deﬁned nodal voltages to the independent voltage source, we have V1 \u0005 V2 \u0001 E \u0001 12 V which results in two equations and two unknowns: 0.25V1 \u0004 0.5V2 \u0001 2 V1 \u0005 1V2 \u0001 12 Substituting: V1 \u0001 V2 \u0004 12 0.25(V2 \u0004 12) \u0004 0.5V2 \u0001 2 and 0.75V2 \u0001 2 \u0005 3 \u0001\u00051 so that V2 \u0001\u0001 \u00021.333 V and V1 \u0001 V2 \u0004 12 V \u0001\u00051.333 V \u0004 12 V \u0001 \u000510.667 V The current of the network can then be determined as follows: I1 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 2.667 A I2 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 0.667 A I3 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 1.2 A 12 V\u0003 10 \u0002 10.667 V \u0005 (\u00051.333 V)\u0003\u0003\u0003 10 \u0002 V1 \u0005 V2\u0003 10 \u0002 1.333 V\u0003 2 \u0002 V2\u0003 R2 10.667 V\u0003 4 \u0002 V \u0003 R1 \u00051\u0003 0.75 V2\u0003 2 \u0002 V1\u0003 4 \u0002 V2\u0003 R2 V1\u0003 R1 NA286  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (dc) A careful examination of the network at the beginning of the analy- sis would have revealed that the voltage across the resistor R3 must be 12 V and I3 must be equal to 1.2 A. 8.10 NODAL ANALYSIS (FORMAT APPROACH) A close examination of Eq. (8.3) appearing in Example 8.21 reveals that the subscripted voltage at the node in which Kirchhoff’s current law is applied is multiplied by the sum of the conductances attached to that node. Note also that the other nodal voltages within the same equa- tion are multiplied by the negative of the conductance between the two nodes. The current sources are represented to the right of the equals sign with a positive sign if they supply current to the node and with a negative sign if they draw current from the node. These conclusions can be expanded to include networks with any number of nodes. This will allow us to write nodal equations rapidly and in a form that is convenient for the use of determinants. A major requirement, however, is that all voltage sources must ﬁrst be converted to current sources before the procedure is applied. Note the parallelism between the following four steps of application and those required for mesh analysis in Section 8.8: 1. Choose a reference node and assign a subscripted voltage label to the (N \u0002 1) remaining nodes of the network. 2. The number of equations required for a complete solution is equal to the number of subscripted voltages (N \u0002 1). Column 1 of each equation is formed by summing the conductances tied to the node of interest and multiplying the result by that subscripted nodal voltage. 3. We must now consider the mutual terms that, as noted in the preceding example, are always subtracted from the ﬁrst column. It is possible to have more than one mutual term if the nodal voltage of current interest has an element in common with more than one other nodal voltage. This will be demonstrated in an example to follow. Each mutual term is the product of the mutual conductance and the other nodal voltage tied to that conductance. 4. The column to the right of the equality sign is the algebraic sum of the current sources tied to the node of interest. A current source is assigned a positive sign if it supplies current to a node and a negative sign if it draws current from the node. 5. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations for the desired voltages. Let us now consider a few examples.

There- fore, V4 is simply a midvoltage level between V1 and V3 and is known if V1 and V3 are available.

In the chapters to follow, it will be employed in both dc and ac meters. In the electronics courses it will be encoun- tered early in the discussion of rectifying circuits employed in convert- ing a varying signal to one of a steady nature (such as dc). A number of other areas of application also require some knowledge of ac networks; these areas will be discussed later. The bridge network may appear in one of the three forms as indi- cated in Fig. 8.63. The network of Fig. 8.63(c) is also called a symmet- rical lattice network if R2 \u0004 R3 and R1 \u0004 R4.

Constant Current Alarm Systems The basic components of an alarm system employing a constant current supply are provided in Fig. 8.86. This design is improved over that pro- vided in Chapter 5 in the sense that it is less sensitive to changes in resistance in the circuit due to heating, humidity, changes in the length of the line to the sensors, and so on. The 1.5-k\u0001 rheostat (total resis- tance between points a and b) is adjusted to ensure a current of 5 mA through the single-series security circuit. The adjustable rheostat is nec- essary to compensate for variations in the total resistance of the circuit introduced by the resistance of the wire, sensors, sensing relay, and mil- liammeter. The milliammeter is included to set the rheostat and ensure a current of 5 mA.

If any of the sensors should open, the current through the entire cir- cuit will drop to zero, the coil of the relay will release the plunger, and contact will be made with the N/C position of the relay. This action will complete the circuit for the bell circuit, and the alarm will sound. For the future, keep in mind that switch positions for a relay are always shown with no power to the network, resulting in the N/C position of Fig. 8.86. When power is applied, the switch will have the position indi- cated by the dashed line. That is, various factors, such as a change in resistance of any of the elements due to heating, humidity, and so on, would cause the applied voltage to redistribute itself and create a sensi- tive situation. With an adjusted 5 mA, the loading can change, but the current will always be 5 mA and the chance of tripping reduced. Take note of the fact that the relay is rated as 5 V at 5 mA, indicating that in the on state the voltage across the relay is 5 V and the current through the relay 5 mA. Its internal resistance is therefore 5 V/5 mA \u0004 1 k\u0001 in this state. A more advanced alarm system using a constant current is provided in Fig. 8.87. In this case an electronic system employing a single tran- 302  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (dc) sistor, biasing resistors, and a dc battery are establishing a current of 4 mA through the series sensor circuit connected to the positive side of an operational ampliﬁer (op-amp). Although the transistor and op-amp devices may be new to you, they will be discussed in detail in your electronics courses—you do not need to be aware of the details of their operation for now. Sufﬁce it to say for the moment that the transistor in this application is being used not as an ampliﬁer but as part of a design to establish a constant current through the circuit. The op-amp is a very useful component of numerous electronic systems, and it has important terminal characteristics established by a variety of components internal to its design. The LM2900 operational ampliﬁer of Fig. 8.87 is one of four found in the dual-in-line integrated circuit package appearing in Fig. 8.88(a). Pins 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14 were used for the design of Fig. 8.87. Note in Fig. 8.88(b) the number of elements required to establish the desired terminal characteristics—the details of which will be inves- tigated in your electronics courses. In Fig. 8.87, the designed 15-V dc supply, biasing resistors, and tran- sistor in the upper right-hand corner of the schematic establish a con- stant 4-mA current through the circuit. It is referred to as a constant current source because the current will remain fairly constant at 4 mA even though there may be moderate variations in the total resistance of the series sensor circuit connected to the transistor. Following the 4 mA through the circuit, we ﬁnd that it enters terminal 2 (positive side of the input) of the op-amp. A second current of 2 mA, called the reference current, is established by the 15-V source and resistance R and enters terminal 3 (negative side of the input) of the op-amp. The reference cur- rent of 2 mA is necessary to establish a current for the 4-mA current of the network to be compared against. So long as the 4-mA current exists, the operational ampliﬁer will provide a “high” output voltage that exceeds 13.5 V, with a typical level of 14.2 V (according to the speciﬁ- cation sheet for the op-amp). However, if the sensor current drops from 4 mA to a level below the reference level of 2 mA, the op-amp will respond with a “low” output voltage that is typically about 0.1 V. The output of the operational ampliﬁer will then signal the alarm circuit about the disturbance. Note from the above that it is not necessary for the sensor current to drop to 0 mA to signal the alarm circuit—just a variation around the reference level that appears unusual. One very important characteristic of this particular op-amp is that the input impedance to the op-amp is relatively low. This feature is important because you don’t want alarm circuits reacting to every voltage spike or turbulence that comes down the line because of external switching action NA Magnetic switch Window foil Door switch 2 mA 4 mA +15 V Rref 3 2 +15 V + – LM2900 14 7 4 Output Constant current source To alarm bell circuit +15 V 4 mA RE R2 R1 Op-Amp FIG. 8.87 Constant current alarm system with electronic components.

In Fig. 8.88(c), for instance, if a high voltage should appear at the input to the series conﬁguration, most of the voltage will be absorbed by the series resistance of the sensor circuit rather than traveling across the input terminals of the operational ampli- ﬁer—thus preventing a false output and an activation of the alarm. Wheatstone Bridge Smoke Detector TheWheatstone bridge is a popular network conﬁguration whenever detec- tion of small changes in a quantity is required. In Fig. 8.89(a), the dc bridge conﬁguration is employing a photoelectric device to detect the presence of smoke and to sound the alarm. A photograph of an actual photoelectric smoke detector appears in Fig. 8.89(b), and the internal construction of the unit is shown in Fig. 8.89(c).

The clear plastic separation ensures that the light hitting the light sensor in the upper chamber is not affected by the entering smoke. It estab- lishes a reference level to compare against the chamber with the entering smoke. If no smoke is present, the difference in response between the sen- sor cells will be registered as the normal situation. Of course, if both cells were exactly identical, and if the clear plastic did not cut down on the light, both sensors would establish the same reference level, and their difference would be zero. However, this is seldom the case, so a reference difference is recognized as the sign that smoke is not present. However, once smoke is present, there will be a sharp difference in the sensor reaction from the norm, and the alarm should be sounded. In Fig. 8.89(a), we ﬁnd that the two sensors are located on opposite arms of the bridge. With no smoke present the balance-adjust rheostat will be used to ensure that the voltage V between points a and b is zero volts and the resulting current through the primary of the sensitive relay will be zero amperes. Taking a look at the relay, we ﬁnd that the absence of a voltage from a to b will leave the relay coil unenergized and the switch in the N/O position (recall that the position of a relay switch is always drawn in the unenergized state). An unbalanced situation will result in a voltage across the coil and activation of the relay, and the switch will move to the N/C position to complete the alarm circuit and activate the alarm. Relays with two contacts and one movable arm are called single-pole–double-throw (SPDT) relays. The dc power is required to set up the balance situation, energize the parallel bulb so we know that the system is on, and provide the voltage from a to b if an unbalanced situation should develop. One may ask why only one sensor isn’t used since its resistance would be sensitive to the presence of smoke. The answer lies in the fact that the smoke detector might generate a false readout if the supply voltage or output light intensity of the bulb should vary. Smoke detec- tors of the type just described must be used in gas stations, kitchens, dentist ofﬁces, etc., where the range of gas fumes present may set off an ionizing type smoke detector.

APPLICATIONS  305 Schematic with Nodal Voltages When an investigator is presented with a system that is down or not operating properly, one of the ﬁrst options is to check the system’s speciﬁed voltages on the schematic. These speciﬁed voltage levels are actually the nodal voltages determined in this chapter. Nodal voltage is simply a special term for a voltage measured from that point to ground. The technician will attach the negative or lower-potential lead to the ground of the network (often the chassis) and then place the positive or higher-potential lead on the speciﬁed points of the network to check the nodal voltages. If they match, it is a good sign that that section of the system is operating properly. If one or more fail to match the given val- ues, the problem area can usually be identiﬁed. Be aware that a reading of \u000315.87 V is signiﬁcantly different from an expected reading of \u000216 V if the leads have been properly attached. Although the actual numbers seem close, the difference is actually more than 30 V. One must expect some deviation from the given value as shown, but always be very sensitive to the resulting sign of the reading. The schematic of Fig. 8.90(a) includes the nodal voltages for a logic probe used to measure the input and output states of integrated circuit logic chips. In other words, the probe determines whether the measured voltage is one of two states: high or low (often referred to as “on” or “off” or 1 or 0). If the LOGIC IN terminal of the probe is placed on a chip at a location where the voltage is between 0 and 1.2 V, the voltage is considered a low level, and the green LED will light. (LEDs are light- emitting semiconductor diodes that will emit light when current is passed through them.) If the measured voltage is between 1.8 V and 5V, the reading is considered high, and the red LED will light. Any voltage between 1.2 V and 1.8 V is considered a “ﬂoating level” and is an indication that the system being measured is not operating correctly. Note that the reference levels mentioned above are established by the voltage divider network to the right of the schematic. The op-amps employed are of such high input impedance that their loading on the voltage divider network can be ignored and the voltage divider network considered a network unto itself. Even though three 5.5-V dc supply voltages are indicated on the diagram, be aware that all three points are connected to the same supply. The other voltages provided (the nodal voltages) are the voltage levels that should be present from that point to ground if the system is working properly. The op-amps are used to sense the difference between the reference at points 3 and 6 and the voltage picked up in LOGIC IN. Any differ- ence will result in an output that will light either the green or the red LED. Be aware, because of the direct connection, that the voltage at point 3 is the same as shown by the nodal voltage to the left, or 1.8 V. Likewise, the voltage at point 6 is 1.2 V for comparison with the volt- ages at points 5 and 2, which reﬂect the measured voltage. If the input voltage happened to be 1.0 V, the difference between the voltages at points 5 and 6 would be 0.2 V, which ideally would appear at point 7. This low potential at point 7 would result in a current ﬂowing from the much higher 5.5-V dc supply through the green LED, causing it to light and indicating a low condition. By the way, LEDs, like diodes, permit current through them only in the direction of the arrow in the symbol. Also note that the voltage at point 6 must be higher than that at point 5 for the output to turn on the LED. The same is true for point 2 over point 3, which reveals why the red LED does not light when the 1.0-V level is measured. NA306  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (dc) Oftentimes it is impractical to draw the full network as shown in Fig. 8.90(b) because there are space limitations or because the same voltage divider network is used to supply other parts of the system. In such cases one must recognize that points having the same shape are con- nected, and the number in the ﬁgure reveals how many connections are made to that point.

The only component that has not been introduced in earlier chapters is the dc current source. It can be obtained by ﬁrst selecting the Place a part key and then the SOURCE library. Scrolling the Part List will result in the option IDC. A left click of IDC followed by OK will result in a dc current source whose direction is toward the bottom of the screen. One left click of the mouse (to make it red—active) followed by a right click of the mouse will result in a listing having a Mirror Vertically option. Selecting that option will ﬂip the source and give it the direction of Fig. 8.70. The remaining parts of the PSpice analysis are pretty straightfor- ward, with the results of Fig. 8.91 matching those obtained in the analy- sis of Fig. 8.70. The voltage across the current source is 8 V positive to ground, and the voltage at either end of the bridge arm is 2.667 V. The voltage across R5 is obviously 0 V for the level of accuracy displayed, and the current is of such a small magnitude compared to the other cur- rent levels of the network that it can essentially be considered 0 A. Note also for the balanced bridge that the current through R1 equals that of R3, and the current through R2 equals that of R4. NA COMPUTER ANALYSIS  307 FIG. 8.91 Applying PSpice to the bridge network of Fig. 8.70. For the analysis, both indicators and a meter will be used to display the desired results. An A indicator in the H position was used for the current through R5, and a V indicator in the V position was used for the voltage across R2. A multimeter in the voltmeter mode was placed to read the voltage across R4. The ammeter is reading the mesh or loop current for that branch, and the two voltmeters are displaying the nodal voltages of the network. After simulation, the results displayed are an exact match with those of Example 8.18. 308  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (dc) Electronics Workbench Electronics Workbench will now be used to verify the results of Exam- ple 8.18.

Included are the superposition, Thévenin’s, Norton’s, maximum power transfer, substitution, Millman’s, and reciprocity theorems. We will consider a number of areas of application for each. Athorough understanding of each theorem is important because a number of the theorems will be applied repeatedly in the material to follow. 9.2 SUPERPOSITION THEOREM The superposition theorem, like the methods of the last chapter, can be used to ﬁnd the solution to networks with two or more sources that are not in series or parallel. The most obvious advantage of this method is that it does not require the use of a mathematical technique such as determinants to ﬁnd the required voltages or currents. Instead, each source is treated independently, and the algebraic sum is found to deter- mine a particular unknown quantity of the network. The superposition theorem states the following: The current through, or voltage across, an element in a linear bilateral network is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents or voltages produced independently by each source. When one is applying the theorem, it is possible to consider the effects of two sources at the same time and reduce the number of net- works that have to be analyzed, but, in general, (9.1) To consider the effects of each source independently requires that sources be removed and replaced without affecting the ﬁnal result.

Any internal resistance or conductance associ- ated with the displaced sources is not eliminated but must still be con- sidered. Figure 9.1 reviews the various substitutions required when removing an ideal source, and Figure 9.2 reviews the substitutions with practical sources that have an internal resistance. (b) P2 = I22R R I2 (c) PT = IT 2R R IT (a) P1 = I12R R I1 FIG. 9.3 Demonstration of the fact that superposition is not applicable to power effects. The total current through any portion of the network is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents produced independently by each source. That is, for a two-source network, if the current produced by one source is in one direction, while that produced by the other is in the opposite direction through the same resistor, the resulting current is the differ- ence of the two and has the direction of the larger. If the individual cur- rents are in the same direction, the resulting current is the sum of two in the direction of either current. This rule holds true for the voltage across a portion of a network as determined by polarities, and it can be extended to networks with any number of sources. The superposition principle is not applicable to power effects since the power loss in a resistor varies as the square (nonlinear) of the current or voltage. For instance, the current through the resistor R of Fig. 9.3(a) is I1 due to one source of a two-source network. The cur- rent through the same resistor due to the other source is I2 as shown in Fig. 9.3(b). Applying the superposition theorem, the total current through the resistor due to both sources is IT,as shown in Fig. 9.3(c) with IT \u0001 I1 \u0002 I2 The power delivered to the resistor in Fig. 9.3(a) is P1 \u0001 I2 1R while the power delivered to the same resistor in Fig. 9.3(b) is P2 \u0001 I2 2 R If we assume that the total power delivered in Fig. 9.3(c) can be obtained by simply adding the power delivered due to each source, we ﬁnd that PT \u0001 P1 \u0002 P2 \u0001 I2 1R \u0002 I2 2 R \u0001 I2 T R or I2 T \u0001 I2 1 \u0002 I2 2 SUPERPOSITION THEOREM  323Th R1 6 \u0001E + – 30 V I 3 A I1 FIG. 9.4 Example 9.1.

Applying Ohm’s law, I″1 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 5 A Since I′1 and I″1 have the same deﬁned direction in Fig. 9.5(a) and (b), the current I1 is the sum of the two, and I1 \u0001 I′1 \u0002 I″1 \u0001 0 A \u0002 5 A \u0001 5 A Note in this case that the current source has no effect on the current through the 6-\u0003 resistor.

In general, therefore, the total power delivered to a resistive element must be determined using the total current through or the total voltage across the element and cannot be determined by a simple sum of the power levels established by each source.

Solution: Setting E \u0001 0 V for the network of Fig. 9.4 results in the network of Fig. 9.5(a), where a short-circuit equivalent has replaced the 30-V source.

In Fig. 9.25(a), for example, the network within the container has only two terminals available to the outside world, labeled a and b. It is possi- ble using Thévenin’s theorem to replace everything in the container with one source and one resistor, as shown in Fig. 9.25(b), and maintain the same terminal characteristics at terminals a and b. That is, any load con- nected to terminals a and b will not know whether it is hooked up to the network of Fig. 9.25(a) or Fig. 9.25(b). The load will receive the same current, voltage, and power from either conﬁguration of Fig. 9.25. Throughout the discussion to follow, however, always keep in mind that the Thévenin equivalent circuit provides an equivalence at the terminals only—the internal construction and characteristics of the original network and the Thévenin equivalent are usually quite different.

Although active in the study and design of tele- graphic systems (including underground transmis- sion), cylindrical condensers (capacitors), and elec- tromagnetism, he is best known for a theorem ﬁrst presented in the French Journal of Physics—Theory and Applications in 1883. It appeared under the heading of “Sur un nouveau théorème d’électricité dynamique” (“On a new theorem of dynamic elec- tricity”) and was originally referred to as the equiv- alent generator theorem. There is some evidence that a similar theorem was introduced by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1853. However, Professor Helmholtz applied the theorem to animal physiol- ogy and not to communication or generator systems, and therefore he has not received the credit in this ﬁeld that he might deserve. In the early 1920s AT&T did some pioneering work using the equiva- lent circuit and may have initiated the reference to the theorem as simply Thévenin’s theorem. In fact, Edward L. Norton, an engineer at AT&T at the time, introduced a current source equivalent of the Thévenin equivalent currently referred to as the Norton equivalent circuit. As an aside, Commandant Thévenin was an avid skier and in fact was commis- sioner of an international ski competition in Cha- monix, France, in 1912. LEON-CHARLES THÉVENIN French (Meaux, Paris) (1857–1927) Telegraph Engineer, Commandant and Educator École Polytech- nique and École Supérieure de Télégraphie Courtesy of the Bibliothèque École Polytechnique, Paris, France For the network of Fig. 9.25(a), the Thévenin equivalent circuit can be found quite directly by simply combining the series batteries and resistors. Note the exact similarity of the network of Fig. 9.25(b) to the Thévenin conﬁguration of Fig. 9.24. The method described below will allow us to extend the procedure just applied to more complex conﬁgu- rations and still end up with the relatively simple network of Fig. 9.24. In most cases, other elements will be connected to the right of ter- minals a and b in Fig. 9.25. To apply the theorem, however, the network to be reduced to the Thévenin equivalent form must be isolated as shown in Fig. 9.25, and the two “holding” terminals identiﬁed. Once the proper Thévenin equivalent circuit has been determined, the voltage, current, or resistance readings between the two “holding” terminals will be the same whether the original or the Thévenin equivalent circuit is connected to the left of terminals a and b in Fig. 9.25. Any load con- nected to the right of terminals a and b of Fig. 9.25 will receive the same voltage or current with either network. This theorem achieves two important objectives. First, as was true for all the methods previously described, it allows us to ﬁnd any par- ticular voltage or current in a linear network with one, two, or any other number of sources. Second, we can concentrate on a speciﬁc portion of a network by replacing the remaining network with an equivalent circuit. In Fig. 9.26, for example, by ﬁnding the Thévenin equivalent circuit for the network in the shaded area, we can quickly calculate the change in current through or voltage across the variable resistor RL for the various values that it may assume. This is demon- strated in Example 9.6. 330  NETWORK THEOREMS Before we examine the steps involved in applying this theorem, it is important that an additional word be included here to ensure that the implications of the Thévenin equivalent circuit are clear. In Fig. 9.26, the entire network, except RL,istobe replaced by a single series resis- tor and battery as shown in Fig. 9.24. The values of these two ele- ments of the Thévenin equivalent circuit must be chosen to ensure that the resistor RL will react to the network of Fig. 9.26(a) in the same manner as to the network of Fig. 9.26(b). In other words, the current through or voltage across RL must be the same for either network for any value of RL. The following sequence of steps will lead to the proper value of RTh and ETh. Preliminary: 1. Remove that portion of the network across which the Thévenin equivalent circuit is to be found. In Fig. 9.26(a), this requires that the load resistor RL be temporarily removed from the network. 2. Mark the terminals of the remaining two-terminal network. (The importance of this step will become obvious as we progress through some complex networks.) RTh: 3. Calculate RTh by ﬁrst setting all sources to zero (voltage sources are replaced by short circuits, and current sources by open circuits) and then ﬁnding the resultant resistance between the two marked terminals. (If the internal resistance of the voltage and/or current sources is included in the original network, it must remain when the sources are set to zero.) ETh: 4. Calculate ETh by ﬁrst returning all sources to their original position and ﬁnding the open-circuit voltage between the marked terminals. (This step is invariably the one that will lead to the most confusion and errors. In all cases, keep in mind that it is the open-circuit potential between the two terminals marked in step 2.) Conclusion: 5. Draw the Thévenin equivalent circuit with the portion of the circuit previously removed replaced between the terminals of the equivalent circuit. This step is indicated by the placement of the resistor RL between the terminals of the Thévenin equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 9.26(b). EXAMPLE 9.6 Find the Thévenin equivalent circuit for the network in the shaded area of the network of Fig. 9.27. Then ﬁnd the current through RL for values of 2 \u0003, 10 \u0003, and 100 \u0003. Solution: Steps 1 and 2 produce the network of Fig. 9.28. Note that the load resis- tor RL has been removed and the two “holding” terminals have been deﬁned as a and b. Step 3: Replacing the voltage source E1 with a short-circuit equivalent yields the network of Fig. 9.29(a), where RTh \u0001 R1 \u0005\u0005 R2 \u0001\u0001 2 \u0001 (3 \u0003)(6 \u0003)\u0004\u0004 3 \u0003\u0002 6 \u0003 Th R2 6 \u0001 R1 3 \u0001 E1 9 V a b + – R1 3 \u0001 R2 6 \u0001 b E1 9 V RL a + – FIG. 9.27 Example 9.6. FIG. 9.28 Identifying the terminals of particular importance when applying Thévenin’s theorem. THÉVENIN’S THEOREM  331 The importance of the two marked terminals now begins to surface. They are the two terminals across which the Thévenin resistance is measured. It is no longer the total resistance as seen by the source, as determined in the majority of problems of Chapter 7. If some difﬁculty develops when determining RTh with regard to whether the resistive ele- ments are in series or parallel, consider recalling that the ohmmeter sends out a trickle current into a resistive combination and senses the level of the resulting voltage to establish the measured resistance level. In Fig. 9.29(b), the trickle current of the ohmmeter approaches the net- work through terminal a, and when it reaches the junction of R1 and R2, it splits as shown. The fact that the trickle current splits and then recom- bines at the lower node reveals that the resistors are in parallel as far as the ohmmeter reading is concerned. In essence, the path of the sensing current of the ohmmeter has revealed how the resistors are connected to the two terminals of interest and how the Thévenin resistance should be determined. Keep the above in mind as you work through the various examples of this section. Step 4: Replace the voltage source (Fig. 9.30). For this case, the open- circuit voltage ETh is the same as the voltage drop across the 6-\u0003 resis- tor. Applying the voltage divider rule, ETh \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 6 V It is particularly important to recognize that ETh is the open-circuit potential between points a and b. Remember that an open circuit can have any voltage across it, but the current must be zero. In fact, the cur- rent through any element in series with the open circuit must be zero also. The use of a voltmeter to measure ETh appears in Fig. 9.31. Note that it is placed directly across the resistor R2 since ETh and VR2 are in parallel.

EXAMPLE 9.7 Find the Thévenin equivalent circuit for the network in the shaded area of the network of Fig. 9.33. Solution: Steps 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 9.34. Step 3 is shown in Fig. 9.35. The current source has been replaced with an open-circuit equivalent, and the resistance determined between ter- minals a and b. In this case an ohmmeter connected between terminals a and b would send out a sensing current that would ﬂow directly through R1 and R2 (at the same level). The result is that R1 and R2 are in series and the Thévenin resistance is the sum of the two.

Steps 1 and 2 are relatively easy to apply, but now we must be careful to “hold” onto the terminals a and b as the Thévenin resistance and voltage are determined.

The value of RTh can then be determined by com- pleting the network with a variable RL such as the potentiometer of Fig. 9.56(b). RL can then be varied until the voltage appearing across the load is one-half the open-circuit value, or VL \u0001 ETh /2. For the series circuit of Fig. 9.56(a), when the load voltage is reduced to one-half the open-circuit level, the voltage across RTh and RL must be the same. If we read the value of RL [as shown in Fig. 9.56(c)] that resulted in the preceding calculations, we will also have the value of RTh, since RL \u0001 RTh if VL equals the voltage across RTh.

Measuring Voc and Isc The Thévenin voltage is again determined by measuring the open-circuit voltage across the terminals of interest; American (Rockland, Maine; Summit, New Jersey) (1898–1983) Electrical Engineer, Scientist, Inventor Department Head: Bell Laboratories Fellow: Acoustical Society and Institute of Radio Engineers Although interested primarily in communications circuit theory and the transmission of data at high speeds over telephone lines, Edward L. Norton is best remembered for development of the dual of Thévenin’s equivalent circuit, currently referred to as Norton’s equivalent circuit. In fact, Norton and his associates at AT&T in the early 1920s are recog- nized as some of the ﬁrst to perform pioneering work applying Thévenin’s equivalent circuit and who referred to this concept simply as Thévenin’s theorem. In 1926 he proposed the equivalent circuit using a current source and parallel resistor to assist in the design of recording instrumentation that was primarily current driven. He began his telephone career in 1922 with the Western Electric Company’s Engineering Department, which later became Bell Laboratories. His areas of active research included network theory, acoustical systems, electromagnetic apparatus, and data transmission. A graduate of MIT and Columbia University, he held nineteen patents on his work. EDWARD L. NORTON 338  NETWORK THEOREMS that is, ETh \u0001 Voc. To determine RTh, a short-circuit condition is estab- lished across the terminals of interest, as shown in Fig. 9.57, and the current through the short circuit is measured with an ammeter. Using Ohm’s law, we ﬁnd that the short-circuit current is determined by Isc \u0001 and the Thévenin resistance by RTh \u0001 However, ETh \u0001 Voc resulting in the following equation for RTh: (9.2) 9.4 NORTON’S THEOREM It was demonstrated in Section 8.3 that every voltage source with a series internal resistance has a current source equivalent. The current source equivalent of the Thévenin network (which, you will note, satis- ﬁes the above conditions), as shown in Fig. 9.58, can be determined by Norton’s theorem. It can also be found through the conversions of Sec- tion 8.3. The theorem states the following: Any two-terminal linear bilateral dc network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source and a parallel resistor, as shown in Fig. 9.58. The discussion of Thévenin’s theorem with respect to the equivalent circuit can also be applied to the Norton equivalent circuit. The steps leading to the proper values of IN and RN are now listed. Preliminary: 1. Remove that portion of the network across which the Norton equivalent circuit is found. 2. Mark the terminals of the remaining two-terminal network. RN: 3. Calculate RN by ﬁrst setting all sources to zero (voltage sources are replaced with short circuits, and current sources with open circuits) and then ﬁnding the resultant resistance between the two marked terminals. (If the internal resistance of the voltage and/or current sources is included in the original network, it must remain when the sources are set to zero.) Since RN \u0001 RTh, the procedure and value obtained using the approach described for Thévenin’s theorem will determine the proper value of RN. IN: 4. Calculate IN by ﬁrst returning all sources to their original position and then ﬁnding the short-circuit current between the marked terminals. It is the same current that would be measured by an ammeter placed between the marked terminals.

Since the Norton and Thévenin resistances are the same, the same procedures can be employed as described for the Thévenin network. 9.5 MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER THEOREM The maximum power transfer theorem states the following: A load will receive maximum power from a linear bilateral dc network when its total resistive value is exactly equal to the Thévenin resistance of the network as “seen” by the load. For the network of Fig. 9.77, maximum power will be delivered to the load when (9.3) From past discussions, we realize that a Thévenin equivalent circuit can be found across any element or group of elements in a linear bilat- eral dc network. Therefore, if we consider the case of the Thévenin equivalent circuit with respect to the maximum power transfer theorem, we are, in essence, considering the total effects of any network across a resistor RL, such as in Fig. 9.77.

MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER THEOREM  345 Note, in particular, that PL is, in fact, a maximum when RL \u0001 RTh \u0001 9 \u0003. The power curve increases more rapidly toward its maximum value than it decreases after the maximum point, clearly revealing that a small change in load resistance for levels of RL below RTh will have a more dramatic effect on the power delivered than similar changes in RL above the RTh level. If we plot VL and IL versus the same resistance scale (Fig. 9.81), we ﬁnd that both change nonlinearly, with the terminal voltage increasing with an increase in load resistance as the current decreases. Note again that the most dramatic changes in VL and IL occur for levels of RL less than RTh. As pointed out on the plot, when RL \u0001 RTh, VL \u0001 ETh/2 and IL \u0001 Imax/2, with Imax \u0001 ETh/RTh.

Keep in mind, how- ever, that the efﬁciency criterion is sensitive only to the ratio of PL to Ps and not to their actual levels. At efﬁciency levels approaching 100%, the power delivered to the load may be so small as to have little practical value.

A relatively low efﬁciency of 50% can be tolerated in situations where power levels are relatively low, such as in a wide variety of elec- tronic systems. However, when large power levels are involved, such as at generating stations, efﬁciencies of 50% would not be acceptable. In fact, a great deal of expense and research is dedicated to raising power- generating and transmission efﬁciencies a few percentage points. Rais- ing an efﬁciency level of a 10-mega-kW power plant from 94% to 95% (a 1% increase) can save 0.1 mega-kW, or 100 million watts, of power—an enormous saving! Consider a change in load levels from 9 \u0003 to 20 \u0003. In Fig. 9.80, the power level has dropped from 100 W to 85.61 W (a 14.4% drop), but the efﬁciency has increased substantially to 69% (a 38% increase), as shown in Fig. 9.82. For each application, therefore, a balance point must be identiﬁed where the efﬁciency is sufﬁciently high without reducing the power to the load to insigniﬁcant levels. Figure 9.83 is a semilog plot of PL and the power delivered by the source Ps \u0001 EThIL versus RL for ETh \u0001 60 V and RTh \u0001 9 \u0003. A semilog graph employs one log scale and one linear scale, as implied by the pre- ﬁx semi, meaning half. Log scales are discussed in detail in Chapter 23. For the moment, note the wide range of RL permitted using the log scale compared to Figs. 9.80 through 9.82. It is now quite clear that the PL curve has only one maximum (at RL \u0001 RTh), whereas Ps decreases for every increase in RL. In particular, note that for low levels of RL, only a small portion of the power delivered by the source makes it to the load. In fact, even when RL \u0001 RTh, the source is generating twice the power absorbed by the load. For values of RL greater than RTh, the two curves approach each other until eventually they are essentially the same at high levels of RL. For the range RL \u0001 RTh \u0001 9 \u0003 to RL \u0001 100 \u0003, PL and Ps are relatively close in magnitude, suggesting that this would be an appropriate range of operation, since a majority of the power delivered by the source is getting to the load and the power levels are still signiﬁcant.

In Fig. 9.92, for example, the three voltage sources can be reduced to one. This would permit ﬁnding the current through or voltage across RL without having to apply a method such as mesh analysis, nodal analysis, superposition, and so on.

(9.10) to include those cases where the sources may not be supplying energy in the same direction. (Note Example 9.18.) The equivalent resistance is Req \u0001\u0001 (9.11) In terms of the resistance values, Eeq \u0001 (9.12) and Req \u0001 (9.13) The relatively few direct steps required may result in the student’s applying each step rather than memorizing and employing Eqs. (9.10) through (9.13). EXAMPLE 9.18 Using Millman’s theorem, ﬁnd the current through and voltage across the resistor RL of Fig. 9.96. Solution: By Eq.

More simply, the theorem states that for branch equivalence, the ter- minal voltage and current must be the same. Consider the circuit of Fig. 9.103, in which the voltage across and current through the branch a-b are determined. Through the use of the substitution theorem, a number of equivalent a-a′ branches are shown in Fig. 9.104. Note that for each equivalent, the terminal voltage and current are the same. Also consider that the response of the remainder of the circuit of Fig. 9.103 is unchanged by substituting any one of the equivalent branches. As demonstrated by the single-source equivalents of Fig. 9.104, a known potential difference and current in a network can be replaced by an ideal voltage source and current source, respectively. Understand that this theorem cannot be used to solve networks with two or more sources that are not in series or parallel. For it to be applied, a potential difference or current value must be known or found using one of the techniques discussed earlier. One application of the theorem is shown in Fig. 9.105. Note that in the ﬁgure the known potential difference V was replaced by a voltage source, permitting the isolation of the portion of the network including R3, R4, and R5. Recall that this was basically the approach employed in the analysis of the ladder network as we worked our way back toward the terminal resis- tance R5.

This substitution is a very speciﬁc application of the substitution theorem. 9.8 RECIPROCITY THEOREM The reciprocity theorem is applicable only to single-source networks. It is, therefore, not a theorem employed in the analysis of multisource networks described thus far. The theorem states the following: The current I in any branch of a network, due to a single voltage source E anywhere else in the network, will equal the current through the branch in which the source was originally located if the source is placed in the branch in which the current I was originally measured. In other words, the location of the voltage source and the resulting current may be interchanged without a change in current. The theorem requires that the polarity of the voltage source have the same corre- spondence with the direction of the branch current in each position. In the representative network of Fig. 9.107(a), the current I due to the voltage source E was determined. If the position of each is inter- changed as shown in Fig. 9.107(b), the current I will be the same value as indicated. To demonstrate the validity of this statement and the theo- rem, consider the network of Fig. 9.108, in which values for the ele- ments of Fig. 9.107(a) have been assigned.

Impedance is a term applied to opposition in ac networks— for the moment think of it as a resistance level. We can also think of impedance as the internal resistance of the source which is normally shown in series with the source voltage as shown in the same ﬁgure. Every speaker has an internal resistance that can be represented as shown in Fig. 9.111(b) for a standard 8-\u0002 speaker. Figure 9.111(c) is a photograph of a commercially available 8-\u0002 woofer (for very low fre- quencies). The primary purpose of the following discussion is to shed some light on how the audio power can be distributed and which approach would be the most effective. Since the maximum power theorem states that the load impedance should match the source impedance for maximum power transfer, let us ﬁrst consider the case of a single 8-\u0002 speaker as shown in Fig. 9.112(a) with an applied ampliﬁer voltage of 12 V. Since the applied voltage will split equally, the speaker voltage is 6 V, and the power to the speaker is a maximum value of P \u0001 V 2/R \u0001 (6 V)2/8 \u0002 \u0001 4.5 W. If we have two 8-\u0002 speakers that we would like to hook up, we have the choice of hooking them up in series or parallel. For the series conﬁguration of Fig. 9.112(b), the resulting current would be I \u0001 E/R \u0001 12 V/24 \u0002\u0001 500 mA, and the power to each speaker would be P \u0001 I 2R \u0001 (500 mA) 2(8 \u0002) \u0001 2W, which is a drop of over 50% from the maximum output level of 4.5 W. If the speakers are hooked up in par- allel as shown in Fig. 9.112(c), the total resistance of the parallel com- bination is 4 \u0002, and the voltage across each speaker as determined by the voltage divider rule will be 4 V. The power to each speaker is P \u0001 V 2/R \u0001 (4 V) 2/8 \u0002 \u0001 2 W which, interestingly enough, is the same power delivered to each speaker whether in series or parallel. However, the parallel arrangement is normally chosen for a variety of reasons. First, when the speakers are connected in parallel, if a wire should become disconnected from one of the speakers due simply to the vibra- tion caused by the emitted sound, the other speakers will still be oper- ating—perhaps not at maximum efﬁciency, but they will still be operat- ing. If in series they would all fail to operate. A second reason relates to the general wiring procedure. When all of the speakers are in parallel, from various parts of a room all the red wires can be connected together and all the black wires together. If the speakers are in series, and if you (a) 8 Ω Ro Amplifier + – 12 V + – 6 V Ri 8-Ω speaker 8 Ω 8 Ω Ro Rspeaker 1 I = 500 mA Amplifier Series speakers + – 12 V Rspeaker 28 Ω (b) Ro Rspeaker 1 8 Ω Rspeaker 2 + – 12 V + – 4 V 8 Ω 8 Ω Amplifier Parallel speakers (c) FIG. 9.112 Speaker connections: (a) single unit; (b) in series; (c) in parallel. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  359Th In any case, always try to match the total resistance of the speaker load to the output resistance of the supply. Yes, a 4-\u0002 speaker can be placed in series with a parallel combination of 8-\u0002 speakers for maxi- mum power transfer from the supply since the total resistance will be 8 \u0002. However, the power distribution will not be equal, with the 4-\u0002 speaker receiving 2.25 W and the 8-\u0002 speakers each 1.125 W for a total of 4.5 W. The 4-\u0002 speaker is therefore receiving twice the audio power of the 8-\u0002 speakers, and this difference may cause distortion or imbal- ance in the listening area. All speakers have maximum and minimum levels. A 50-W speaker is rated for a maximum output power of 50 W and will provide that level on demand. However, in order to function properly, it will proba- bly need to be operating at least at the 1- to 5-W level. A 100-W speaker typically needs between 5 W and 10 W of power to operate properly. It is also important to realize that power levels less than the rated value (such as 40 W for the 50-W speaker) will not result in an increase in distortion, but simply in a loss of volume. However, distor- tion will result if you exceed the rated power level. For example, if we apply 2.5 W to a 2-W speaker, we will deﬁnitely have distortion. How- ever, applying 1.5 W will simply result in less volume. A rule of thumb regarding audio levels states that the human ear can sense changes in audio level only if you double the applied power [a 3-dB increase; deci- bels (dB) will be introduced in Chapter 23]. The doubling effect is always with respect to the initial level. For instance, if the original level were 2 W, you would have to go to 4 W to notice the change. If start- ing at 10 W, you would have to go to 20 W to appreciate the increase in volume. An exception to the above is at very low power levels or very high power levels. For instance, a change from 1 W to 1.5 W may be discernible, just as a change from 50 W to 80 W may be noticeable. 9.10 COMPUTER ANALYSIS Once the mechanics of applying a software package or language are understood, the opportunity to be creative and innovative presents itself.

Speakers are also available with input impedances of 4 \u0002 and 16 \u0002. If you know that the output impedance is 8 \u0002, purchasing either two 4-\u0002 speakers or two 16-\u0002 speakers would result in maximum power to the speakers as shown in Fig. 9.113. The 16-\u0002 speakers would be con- nected in parallel and the 4-\u0002 speakers in series to establish a total load impedance of 8 \u0002. 360  NETWORK THEOREMS Th programmers develop a catalog of innovative techniques that are not only functional but very interesting and truly artistic in nature. Now that some of the basic operations associated with PSpice have been introduced, a few innovative maneuvers will be made in the examples to follow. PSpice Superposition Let us now apply superposition to the network of Fig 9.114, which appeared earlier as Fig. 9.10 in Example 9.3, to per- mit a comparison of resulting solutions. The current through R2 is to be determined. Using methods described in earlier chapters for the appli- cation of PSpice, the network of Fig. 9.115 will result to determine the effect of the 36-V voltage source. Note that both VDC and IDC (ﬂipped vertically) appear in the network. The current source, however, was set to zero simply by selecting the source and changing its value to 0 A in the Display Properties dialog box.

FIG. 9.115 Using PSpice to determine the contribution of the 36-V voltage source to the current through R2. Following simulation, the results appearing in Fig. 9.115 will result. The current through the 6-\u0002 resistor is 2 A due solely to the 36-V volt- age source. Although direction is not indicated, it is fairly obvious in this case. For those cases where it is not obvious, the voltage levels can be displayed, and the direction would be from the point of high poten- tial to the point of lower potential. For the effects of the current source, the voltage source is set to 0 V as shown in Fig. 9.116. The resulting current is then 6 A through R2, with the same direction as the contribution due to the voltage source. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  361Th The resulting current for the resistor R2 is the sum of the two cur- rents: IT \u0001 2 A \u0003 6 A \u0001 8 A, as determined in Example 9.3. Thévenin’s Theorem The application of Thévenin’s theorem requires an interesting maneuver to determine the Thévenin resistance. It is a maneuver, however, that has application beyond Thévenin’s the- orem whenever a resistance level is required.

Since PSpice is not set up to measure resistance levels directly, a 1-A current source can be applied as shown in Fig. 9.118, and Ohm’s law 362  NETWORK THEOREMS Th can be used to determine the magnitude of the Thévenin resistance in the following manner: \u0001RTh\u0001 \u0001 \u0002 \u0004 V Is s \u0004\u0002 \u0001 \u0002 \u0004 1 V A s\u0004 \u0002 \u0001 \u0001Vs\u0001 In Eq. (9.16), since Is \u0001 1 A, the magnitude of RTh in ohms is the same as the magnitude of the voltage Vs (in volts) across the current source. The result is that when the voltage across the current source is dis- played, it can be read as ohms rather than volts. When PSpice is applied, the network will appear as shown in Fig. 9.118. The voltage source E1 and the current source are ﬂipped using a right click on the source and using the Mirror Vertically option. Both voltage sources are set to zero through the Display Properties dialog box obtained by double-clicking on the source symbol. The result of the Bias Point simulation is 2 kV across the current source. The Thévenin resistance is therefore 2 k\u0002 between the two terminals of the network to the left of the current source (to match the results of Example 9.10). In total, by setting the voltage sources to 0 V, we have dictated that the voltage is the same at both ends of the voltage source, replicating the effect of a short-circuit connection between the two points. Forthe open-circuit Thévenin voltage between the terminals of inter- est, the network must be constructed as shown in Fig. 9.119. The resis- tance of 1 T (\u00011million M\u0002)is considered large enough to represent an open circuit to permit an analysis of the network using PSpice. PSpice does not recognize ﬂoating nodes and would generate an error signal if a connection were not made from the top right node to ground. Both volt- age sources are now set on their prescribed values, and a simulation will FIG. 9.118 Using PSpice to determine the Thévenin resistance of a network through the application of a 1-A current source. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  363Th result in 3 V across the 1-T resistor. The open-circuit Thévenin voltage is therefore 3 V which agrees with the solution of Example 9.10. Maximum Power Transfer The procedure for plotting a quantity versus a parameter of the network will now be introduced. In this case it will be the output power versus values of load resistance to verify the fact that maximum power will be delivered to the load when its value equals the series Thévenin resistance. A number of new steps will be introduced, but keep in mind that the method has broad application beyond Thévenin’s theorem and is therefore well worth the learning process. The circuit to be analyzed appears in Fig. 9.120. The circuit is con- structed in exactly the same manner as described earlier except for the value of the load resistance. Begin the process by starting a New Project called MaxPower, and build the circuit of Fig. 9.120. For the moment hold off on setting the value of the load resistance. The ﬁrst step will be to establish the value of the load resistance as a variable since it will not be assigned a ﬁxed value. Double-click on the value of RL to obtain the Display Properties dialog box. For Value, type in {Rval} and click in place. The brackets (not parenthe- ses) are required, but the variable does not have to be called Rval—it is the choice of the user. Next select the Place part keyto obtain the Place Part dialog box. If you are not already in the Libraries list, choose Add Library and add SPECIAL to the list. Select the SPE- CIAL library and scroll the Part List until PARAM appears. Select it; then click OK to obtain a rectangular box next to the cursor on the FIG. 9.119 Using PSpice to determine the Thévenin voltage for a network using a very large resistance value to represent the open-circuit condition between the terminals of interest. 364  NETWORK THEOREMS Th screen. Select a spot near Rval, and deposit the rectangle. The result is PARAMETERS: as shown in Fig. 9.120. Next double-click on PARAMETERS: to obtain a Property Edi- tor dialog box which should have SCHEMATIC1:PAGE1 in the sec- ond column from the left. Now select the New Column option from the top list of choices to obtain the Add New Column dialog box. Enter the Name:Rval and Value:1 followed by an OK to leave the dialog box. The result is a return to the Property Editor dialog box but with Rval and its value (below Rval) added to the horizontal list. Now select Rval/1 by clicking on Rval to surround Rval by a dashed line and add a black background around the 1. Choose Display to produce the Display Properties dialog box, and select Name and Value followed by OK. Then exit the Property Editor dialog box (X) to obtain the screen of Fig. 9.120. Note that now the ﬁrst value (1 \u0002) of Rval is displayed. We are now ready to set up the simulation process. Select the New Simulation Proﬁle key to obtain the New Simulation dialog box. Enter DC Sweep under Name followed by Create. The Simulation Settings-DC Sweep dialog box will appear. After selecting Analysis, select DC Sweep under the Analysis type heading. Then leave the Pri- mary Sweep under the Options heading, and select Global parameter under the Sweep variable. The Parameter name should then be entered as Rval. For the Sweep type, the Start value should be 1 \u0002; but if we use 1 \u0002, the curve to be generated will start at 1 \u0002, leaving a blank from 0 to 1 \u0002. The curve will look incomplete. To solve this problem, we will select 0.001 \u0002 as the Start value (very close to 0 \u0002) and the End value 30.001 \u0002 with an Increment of 1 \u0002. The values of RL will therefore be 0.001 \u0002, 1.001 \u0002, 2.001 \u0002, etc., although the plot FIG. 9.120 Using PSpice to plot the power to RL for a range of values for RL. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  365 will look as if the values were 0 \u0002, 1 \u0002, 2 \u0002, etc. Click OK, and select the Run PSpice key to obtain the display of Fig. 9.121. First note that there are no plots on the graph and that the graph extends to 35 \u0002 rather than 30 \u0002 as desired. It did not respond with a plot of power versus RL because we have not deﬁned the plot of interest for the computer. This is done by selecting the Add Trace key (the key in the middle of the lower toolbar that looks like a red sawtooth waveform) or Trace-Add Trace from the top menu bar. Either choice will result in the Add Traces dialog box. The most important region of this dialog box is the Trace Expression listing at the bottom. The desired trace can be typed in directly, or the quantities of interest can be chosen from the list of Simulation Output Variables and deposited in the Trace Expres- sion listing. Since we are interested in the power to RL for the chosen range of values for RL, W(RL) is selected in the listing; it will then appear as the Trace Expression. Click OK, and the plot of Fig. 9.122 will appear. Originally, the plot extended from 0 \u0002 to 35 \u0002.We reduced the range to 0 \u0002 to 30 \u0002 by selecting Plot-Axis Settings-X Axis-User Deﬁned 0 to 30-OK. Select the Toggle cursor key (which looks like a red curve passing through the origin of a graph), and then left-click the mouse. A vertical line and a horizonal line will appear, with the vertical line controlled by the position of the cursor. Moving the cursor to the peak value will result in A1 \u0001 9.0010 as the x value and 100.000 W as the y value as shown in the Probe Cursor box at the right of the screen. A second cursor can be generated by a right click of the mouse, which was set at RL \u0001 30.001 \u0002 to result in a power of 71.005 W. Notice also that the Th FIG. 9.121 Plot resulting from the dc sweep of RL for the network of Fig. 9.120 before deﬁning the parameters to be displayed. 366  NETWORK THEOREMS Th plot generated appears as a listing at the bottom left of the screen as W(RL). Before leaving the subject, we should mention that the power to RL can be determined in more ways than one from the Add Traces dialog box. For example, ﬁrst enter a minus sign because of the resulting cur- rent direction through the resistor, and then select V2(RL) followed by the multiplication of I(RL). The following expression will appear in the Trace Expression box: V2(RL)*I(RL), which is an expression having the basic power format of P \u0001 V * I. Click OK, and the same power curve of Fig. 9.122 will appear. Other quantities, such as the voltage across the load and the current through the load, can be plotted against RL by simply following the sequence Trace-Delete All Traces-Trace- Add Trace-V1(RL) or I(RL).

We will now consider two additional passive devices called the capacitor and the inductor (the inductor is discussed in detail in Chap- ter 12), which are quite different from the resistor in purpose, operation, and construction. Unlike the resistor, both elements display their total characteristics only when a change in voltage or current is made in the circuit in which they exist. In addition, if we consider the ideal situation, they do not dissipate energy as does the resistor but store it in a form that can be returned to the circuit whenever required by the circuit design. Proper treatment of each requires that we devote this entire chapter to the capacitor and, as mentioned above, Chapter 12 to the inductor. Since electromagnetic effects are a major consideration in the design of inductors, this topic will be covered in Chapter 11. 10.2 THE ELECTRIC FIELD Recall from Chapter 2 that a force of attraction or repulsion exists between two charged bodies. We shall now examine this phenomenon in greater detail by considering the electric ﬁeld that exists in the region around any charged body. This electric ﬁeld is represented by electric ﬂux lines, which are drawn to indicate the strength of the electric ﬁeld at any point around the charged body; that is, the denser the lines of ﬂux, the stronger the electric ﬁeld. In Fig. 10.1, the electric ﬁeld strength is stronger at position a than at position b because the ﬂux lines are denser at a than at b. The symbol for electric ﬂux is the Greek let- ter w (psi). The ﬂux per unit area (ﬂux density) is represented by the capital letter D and is determined by (ﬂux/unit area) (10.1)D \u0001 \u0002 w A \u0002 Capacitors 376  CAPACITORS The larger the charge Q in coulombs, the greater the number of ﬂux lines extending or terminating per unit area, independent of the sur- rounding medium. Twice the charge will produce twice the ﬂux per unit area. The two can therefore be equated: (coulombs, C) (10.2) By deﬁnition, the electric ﬁeld strength at a point is the force act- ing on a unit positive charge at that point; that is, (newtons/coulomb, N/C) (10.3) The force exerted on a unit positive charge (Q2 \u0001 1 C), by a charge Q1, r meters away, as determined by Coulomb’s law is F \u0001 \u0002 kQ r 1 2 Q2\u0002 \u0001 \u0002 kQ r 1 2 (1) \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 k r Q 21 \u0002 (k \u0001 9 \u0003 10 9 N.m 2/C 2) Substituting this force F into Eq. (10.3) yields \u0001 \u0001\u0001 (N/C) (10.4) We can therefore conclude that the electric ﬁeld strength at any point distance r from a point charge of Q coulombs is directly proportional to the magnitude of the charge and inversely proportional to the distance squared from the charge. The squared term in the denominator will result in a rapid decrease in the strength of the electric ﬁeld with dis- tance from the point charge. In Fig. 10.1, substituting distances r1 and r2 into Eq. (10.4) will verify our previous conclusion that the electric ﬁeld strength is greater at a than at b. Electric ﬂux lines always extend from a positively charged body to a negatively charged body, always extend or terminate perpendicular to the charged surfaces, and never intersect. For two charges of similar and opposite polarities, the ﬂux distribution would appear as shown in Fig. 10.2. \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 k r Q 21 \u0002 kQ1/r 2 \u0002 1 F \u0002 Q2 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 Q F \u0002 w \u0001 Q r1 + r2 a b Positive charge Electric flux lines Flux lines radiate outward for positive charges and inward for negative charges.

CAPACITANCE  377 The attraction and repulsion between charges can now be explained in terms of the electric ﬁeld and its ﬂux lines. In Fig. 10.2(a), the ﬂux lines are not interlocked but tend to act as a buffer, preventing attraction and causing repulsion. Since the electric ﬁeld strength is stronger (ﬂux lines denser) for each charge the closer we are to the charge, the more we try to bring the two charges together, the stronger will be the force of repulsion between them. In Fig. 10.2(b), the ﬂux lines extending from the positive charge are terminated at the negative charge. A basic law of physics states that electric ﬂux lines always tend to be as short as possible. The two charges will therefore be drawn to each other. Again, the closer the two charges, the stronger the attraction between the two charges due to the increased ﬁeld strengths. 10.3 CAPACITANCE Up to this point we have considered only isolated positive and negative spherical charges, but the analysis can be extended to charged surfaces of any shape and size. In Fig. 10.3, for example, two parallel plates of a conducting material separated by an air gap have been connected through a switch and a resistor to a battery. If the parallel plates are ini- tially uncharged and the switch is left open, no net positive or negative charge will exist on either plate. The instant the switch is closed, how- ever, electrons are drawn from the upper plate through the resistor to the positive terminal of the battery. There will be a surge of current at ﬁrst, limited in magnitude by the resistance present. The level of ﬂow will then decline, as will be demonstrated in the sections to follow. This action creates a net positive charge on the top plate. Electrons are being repelled by the negative terminal through the lower conductor to the bottom plate at the same rate they are being drawn to the positive ter- minal. This transfer of electrons continues until the potential difference across the parallel plates is exactly equal to the battery voltage. The ﬁnal result is a net positive charge on the top plate and a negative charge on the bottom plate, very similar in many respects to the two isolated charges of Fig. 10.2(b). This element, constructed simply of two parallel conducting plates separated by an insulating material (in this case, air), is called a capac- itor. Capacitance is a measure of a capacitor’s ability to store charge on its plates—in other words, its storage capacity. A capacitor has a capacitance of 1 farad if 1 coulomb of charge is deposited on the plates by a potential difference of 1 volt across the plates. The farad is named after Michael Faraday (Fig. 10.4), a nineteenth- century English chemist and physicist. The farad, however, is gener- ally too large a measure of capacitance for most practical applications, so the microfarad (10\u00046)or picofarad (10 \u000412)is more commonly used. Expressed as an equation, the capacitance is determined by C \u0001 farads (F) Q \u0001 coulombs (C) (10.5) V \u0001 volts (V) Different capacitors for the same voltage across their plates will acquire greater or lesser amounts of charge on their plates. Hence the capacitors have a greater or lesser capacitance, respectively. A cross-sectional view of the parallel plates is shown with the distri- bution of electric ﬂux lines in Fig. 10.5(a).

FIG. 10.4 Michael Faraday. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 51,147 English (London) (1791–1867) Chemist and Electrical Experimenter Honory Doctorate, Oxford University, 1832 An experimenter with no formal education, he began his research career at the Royal Institute in London as a laboratory assistant. Intrigued by the interaction between electrical and magnetic effects, he discov- ered electromagnetic induction, demonstrating that electrical effects can be generated from a magnetic ﬁeld (the birth of the generator as we know it today). He also discovered self-induced currents and intro- duced the concept of lines and ﬁelds of magnetic force. Having received over one hundred academic and scientiﬁc honors, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824 at the young age of 32. unit area (D) between the two plates is quite uniform. At the edges, the ﬂux lines extend outside the common surface area of the plates, pro- ducing an effect known as fringing. This effect, which reduces the capacitance somewhat, can be neglected for most practical applications. For the analysis to follow, we will assume that all the ﬂux lines leaving the positive plate will pass directly to the negative plate within the com- mon surface area of the plates [Fig. 10.5(b)]. If a potential difference of V volts is applied across the two plates separated by a distance of d, the electric ﬁeld strength between the plates is determined by (volts/meter, V/m) (10.6) The uniformity of the ﬂux distribution in Fig. 10.5(b) also indicates that the electric ﬁeld strength is the same at any point between the two plates. Many values of capacitance can be obtained for the same set of par- allel plates by the addition of certain insulating materials between the plates. In Fig. 10.6(a), an insulating material has been placed between a set of parallel plates having a potential difference of V volts across them. Since the material is an insulator, the electrons within the insulator are unable to leave the parent atom and travel to the positive plate. The positive components (protons) and negative components (electrons) of each atom do shift, however [as shown in Fig. 10.6(a)], to form dipoles. When the dipoles align themselves as shown in Fig. 10.6(a), the mate- rial is polarized. A close examination within this polarized material will indicate that the positive and negative components of adjoining dipoles are neutralizing the effects of each other [note the dashed area in Fig. 10.6(a)]. The layer of positive charge on one surface and the negative charge on the other are not neutralized, however, resulting in the estab- lishment of an electric ﬁeld within the insulator [\u0001dielectric; Fig. 10.6(b)]. The net electric ﬁeld between the plates (\u0001resultant \u0001 \u0001air \u0004 \u0001dielectric) would therefore be reduced due to the insertion of the dielectric. The purpose of the dielectric, therefore, is to create an electric ﬁeld to oppose the electric ﬁeld set up by free charges on the parallel plates. For this reason, the insulating material is referred to as a dielectric, di for “opposing” and electric for “electric ﬁeld.” In either case—with or without the dielectric—if the potential across the plates is kept constant and the distance between the plates is ﬁxed, the net electric ﬁeld within the plates must remain the same, as deter- mined by the equation \u0001 \u0001 V/d. We just ascertained, however, that the net electric ﬁeld between the plates would decrease with insertion of the dielectric for a ﬁxed amount of free charge on the plates. To compensate and keep the net electric ﬁeld equal to the value determined by V and d, more charge must be deposited on the plates. [Look ahead to Eq. (10.11).] This additional charge for the same potential across the plates increases the capacitance, as determined by the following equation: C D \u0001 For different dielectric materials between the same two parallel plates, different amounts of charge will be deposited on the plates.

CAPACITANCE  379 w \u0001 Q, so the dielectric is also determining the number of ﬂux lines between the two plates and consequently the ﬂux density (D \u0001 w/A) since A is ﬁxed. The ratio of the ﬂux density to the electric ﬁeld intensity in the dielectric is called the permittivity of the dielectric: e \u0001 (farads/meter, F/m) (10.7) It is a measure of how easily the dielectric will “permit” the establish- ment of ﬂux lines within the dielectric. The greater its value, the greater the amount of charge deposited on the plates, and, consequently, the greater the ﬂux density for a ﬁxed area. For a vacuum, the value of e (denoted by eo) is 8.85 \u0003 10 \u000412 F/m. The ratio of the permittivity of any dielectric to that of a vacuum is called the relative permittivity, er. It simply compares the permittivity of the dielectric to that of air. In equation form, er \u0001 (10.8) The value of e for any material, therefore, is e \u0001 ereo Note that er is a dimensionless quantity. The relative permittivity, or dielectric constant, as it is often called, is provided in Table 10.1 for various dielectric materials. Substituting for D and \u0001 in Eq. (10.7), we have e \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 But C \u0001 and, therefore, e \u0001 Cd \u0002 A Q \u0002 V Qd \u0002 VA Q/A\u0002 V/d w/A\u0002 V/d D \u0002 \u0001 e \u0002 eo D \u0002 \u0001 TABLE 10.1 Relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of various dielectrics.

The capac- itance, therefore, will be greater if the area of the plates is increased, or the distance between the plates is decreased, or the dielectric is changed so that er is increased. Solving for the distance d in Eq. (10.9), we have D \u0001 and substituting into Eq. (10.6) yields \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 V d \u0002\u0001\u0001 But Q \u0001 CV, and therefore \u0001 \u0001 (V/m) (10.11) which gives the electric ﬁeld intensity between the plates in terms of the permittivity e, the charge Q, and the surface area A of the plates. Thus, we have the ratio \u0001\u0001 er or (10.12) which, in words, states that for the same set of parallel plates, the capacitance using a dielectric (of relative permittivity er) is er times that obtained for a vacuum (or air, approximately) between the plates. This relationship between er and the capacitances provides an excellent experimental method for ﬁnding the value of er for various dielectrics.

The voltage required per unit length (electric ﬁeld intensity) to establish conduction in a dielectric is an indication of its dielectric strength and is called the breakdown voltage. When breakdown occurs, the capaci- tor has characteristics very similar to those of a conductor. A typical example of breakdown is lightning, which occurs when the potential between the clouds and the earth is so high that charge can pass from one to the other through the atmosphere, which acts as the dielectric. The average dielectric strengths for various dielectrics are tabulated in volts/mil in Table 10.2 (1 mil \u0001 0.001 in.). The relative permittivity appears in parentheses to emphasize the importance of considering both factors in the design of capacitors. Take particular note of barium- strontium titanite and mica.

This is the ideal case. In actuality, there are free electrons in every dielectric due in part to impurities in the dielectric and forces within the material itself. When a voltage is applied across the plates of a capacitor, a leakage current due to the free electrons ﬂows from one plate to the other. The current is usually so small, however, that it can be neglected for most practical applications. This effect is represented by a resistor in parallel with the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 10.9(a), whose value is typically more than 100 megohms (M\u0005). Some capacitors, however, such as the electrolytic type, have high leakage currents. When charged and then disconnected from the charging circuit, these capacitors lose their charge in a matter of seconds because of the ﬂow of charge (leakage current) from one plate to the other [Fig. 10.9(b)]. 10.6 TYPES OF CAPACITORS Like resistors, all capacitors can be included under either of two general headings: ﬁxed or variable.

The curved line represents the plate that is usually connected to the point of lower potential. Fixed Capacitors Many types of ﬁxed capacitors are available today. Some of the most common are the mica, ceramic, electrolytic, tantalum, and polyester- ﬁlm capacitors. The typical ﬂat mica capacitor consists basically of mica sheets separated by sheets of metal foil. The plates are connected to two electrodes, as shown in Fig. 10.10. The total area is the area of 384  CAPACITORS one sheet times the number of dielectric sheets. The entire system is encased in a plastic insulating material as shown for the two central units of Fig. 10.11. The mica capacitor exhibits excellent characteristics under stress of temperature variations and high voltage applications (its dielectric strength is 5000 V/mil). Its leakage current is also very small (Rleakage about 1000 M\u0005). Mica capacitors are typically between a few picofarads and 0.2 mF, with voltages of 100 V or more. The ability to “roll” the mica to form the cylindrical shapes of Fig. 10.11 is due to a process whereby the soluble contaminants in natural mica are removed, leaving a paperlike structure resulting from the cohe- sive forces in natural mica. It is commonly referred to as reconstituted mica, although the terminology does not mean “recycled” or “second- hand” mica. For some of the units in the photograph, different levels of capacitance are available between different sets of terminals. The ceramic capacitor is made in many shapes and sizes, two of which are shown in Fig. 10.12. The basic construction, however, is about the same for each, as shown in Fig. 10.13. A ceramic base is coated on two sides with a metal, such as copper or silver, to act as the two plates. The leads are then attached through electrodes to the plates. An insulating coating of ceramic or plastic is then applied over the plates and dielectric. Ceramic capacitors also have a very low leakage current (Rleakage about 1000 M\u0005) and can be used in both dc and ac net- works. They can be found in values ranging from a few picofarads to perhaps 2 mF, with very high working voltages such as 5000 V or more. In recent years there has been increasing interest in monolithic (single-structure) chip capacitors such as those appearing in Fig. 10.14(a) due to their application on hybrid circuitry [networks using both discrete and integrated circuit (IC) components]. There has also been increasing use of microstrip (strip-line) circuitry such as the one in Fig. 10.14(b). Note the small chips in this cutaway section. The L and H of Fig. 10.14(a) indicate the level of capacitance. For example, if in black ink, the letter H represents 16 units of capacitance (in picofarads), or 16 pF. If blue ink is used, a multiplier of 100 is applied, resulting in 1600 pF. Although the size is similar, the type of ceramic material con- trols the capacitance level. The electrolytic capacitor is used most commonly in situations where capacitances of the order of one to several thousand microfarads FIG. 10.11 Mica capacitors. (Courtesy of Custom Electronics Inc.) FIG. 10.12 Ceramic disc capacitors: (a) photograph; (b) construction. Lead wire soldered to silver electrode Solder Ceramic dielectric Dipped phenolic coating Silver electrodes deposited on top and bottom of ceramic disc (b)(a) TYPES OF CAPACITORS  385 are required. They are designed primarily for use in networks where only dc voltages will be applied across the capacitor because they have good insulating characteristics (high leakage current) between the plates in one direction but take on the characteristics of a conductor in the other direction. Electrolytic capacitors are available that can be used in ac circuits (for starting motors) and in cases where the polarity of the dc voltage will reverse across the capacitor for short periods of time. The basic construction of the electrolytic capacitor consists of a roll of aluminum foil coated on one side with an aluminum oxide, the alu- minum being the positive plate and the oxide the dielectric. A layer of paper or gauze saturated with an electrolyte is placed over the alu- minum oxide on the positive plate. Another layer of aluminum without the oxide coating is then placed over this layer to assume the role of the negative plate. In most cases the negative plate is connected directly to the aluminum container, which then serves as the negative terminal for external connections. Because of the size of the roll of aluminum foil, the overall area of this capacitor is large; and due to the use of an oxide as the dielectric, the distance between the plates is extremely small. The negative terminal of the electrolytic capacitor is usually the one with no visible identiﬁcation on the casing. The posi- tive is usually indicated by such designs as \u0006, \u0001, \u0002, and so on. Due to the polarity requirement, the symbol for an electrolytic capacitor will normally appear as . Associated with each electrolytic capacitor are the dc working volt- age and the surge voltage. The working voltage is the voltage that can be applied across the capacitor for long periods of time without break- down. The surge voltage is the maximum dc voltage that can be ap- plied for a short period of time. Electrolytic capacitors are characterized as having low breakdown voltages and high leakage currents (Rleakage about 1 M\u0005). Various types of electrolytic capacitors are shown in Fig. 10.15. They can be found in values extending from a few microfarads to several thousand microfarads and working voltages as high as 500 V. However, increased levels of voltage are normally associated with lower values of available capacitance. \u0006 FIG. 10.13 Multilayer, radial-lead ceramic capacitor.

In each case, tantalum powder of high purity is pressed into a rectangular or cylindrical shape, as shown in Fig. 10.16. Next the anode (\u0006) connection is simply pressed into the resulting structures, as shown in the ﬁgure. The resulting unit is then sintered (baked) in a vacuum at very high temperatures to establish a very porous material. The result is a structure with a very large surface area in a limited volume. Through immersion in an acid solution, a very thin manganese dioxide (MnO2) coating is established on the large, porous surface area. An electrolyte is then added to establish contact between the surface area and the cathode, producing a solid tantalum capacitor. If an appropriate “wet” acid is introduced, it is called a wet-slug tanta- lum capacitor. FIG. 10.15 Electrolytic capacitors: (a) Radial lead with extended endurance rating of 2000 h at 85°C.

The last type of ﬁxed capacitor to be introduced is the polyester-ﬁlm capacitor, the basic construction of which is shown in Fig. 10.17. It consists simply of two metal foils separated by a strip of polyester material such as Mylar ®. The outside layer of polyester is applied to act as an insulating jacket. Each metal foil is connected to a lead that extends either axially or radially from the capacitor. The rolled con- struction results in a large surface area, and the use of the plastic dielec- tric results in a very thin layer between the conducting surfaces. \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0000\u0003\u0002 Solder Cathode ( – ) MnO2 coatCarbon Solder Lead wire Anode ( + ) Tantalum Tantalum wire Metal foils Polyester (plastic) film Data such as capacitance and working voltage are printed on the outer wrapping if the polyester capacitor is large enough.

Its leakage resistance is of the order of 100 M\u0005. An axial lead and radial lead polyester-ﬁlm capacitor appear in Fig. 10.18. The axial lead variety is available with capacitance levels of 0.1 mF to 18 mF, with working voltages extending to 630 V. The radial lead variety has a capacitance range of 0.01 mF to 10 mF, with working voltages extend- ing to 1000 V. FIG. 10.18 Polyester-ﬁlm capacitors: (a) axial lead; (b) radial lead.

The dielectric for each capacitor is air. The capacitance in Fig. 10.19(a) is changed by turning the shaft at one end to vary the common area of the movable and ﬁxed plates. The greater the common area, the larger the capacitance, as determined by Eq. (10.10). The capacitance of the trimmer capacitor in Fig. 10.19(b) is changed by turning the screw, which will vary the distance between the plates (the common area is ﬁxed) and thereby the capacitance.

Simply place the capacitor between the provided clips with the proper polarity, and the meter will display the level of capacitance. The best check of a capacitor is to use a meter designed to perform the necessary tests. However, an ohmmeter can identify those in which the dielectric has deteriorated (especially in paper and electrolytic capacitors). As the dielectric breaks down, the insulating qualities decrease to a point where the resistance between the plates drops to a relatively low level. After ensuring that the capacitor is fully dis- charged, place an ohmmeter across the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 10.21. In a polarized capacitor, the polarities of the meter should match those of the capacitor. A low-resistance reading (zero ohms to a few hundred ohms) normally indicates a defective capacitor. The above test of leakage is not all-inclusive, since some capacitors will break down only when higher voltages are applied. The test, how- ever, does identify those capacitors that have lost the insulating quality of the dielectric between the plates. Standard Values and Recognition Factor The standard values for capacitors employ the same numerical multi- pliers encountered for resistors. The most common have the same numerical multipliers as the most common resistors, that is, those avail- able with the full range of tolerances (5%, 10%, and 20%) as shown in Table 3.8. They include 0.1 mF, 0.15 mF, 0.22 mF, 0.33 mF, 0.47 mF, and 0.68 mF, and then 1 mF, 1.5 mF, 2.2 mF, 3.3 mF, 4.7 mF, and so on. Figure 10.22 was developed to establish a recognition factor when it comes to the various types of capacitors. In other words, it will help you to develop the skills to identify types of capacitors, their typical range of values, and some of the most common applications. The ﬁgure is certainly not all-inclusive, but it does offer a ﬁrst step in establishing a sense for what to expect for various applications. Marking Schemes Due to the small size of some capacitors, various marking schemes have been adopted to provide the capacitance level, the tolerance, and, if possible, the maximum working voltage. In general, however, the size of the capacitor is the ﬁrst indicator of its value. The smaller units are typically in picofarads (pF) and the larger units in microfarads (mF). Keeping this simple fact in mind will usually provide an immediate indication of the expected capacitance level. On larger mF units, the value can usually be printed on the jacket with the tolerance and maxi- mum working voltage. However, smaller units need to use some form of abbreviation as shown in Fig. 10.23. For very small units such as appearing in Fig. 10.23(a), the value is recognized immediately as in pF, with the K an indicator of a \u000710% tolerance level. Too often the K is read as a multiplier of 10 \u00063, and the capacitance read as 20,000 pF or 20 nF. For the unit of Fig. 10.23(b), there was room for a lowercase “n” to represent a multiplier of 10 \u00049. The presence of the lowercase “n” in combination with the small size is clear indication that this is a 200-nF capacitor. To avoid unnecessary confusion, the letters used for tolerance do not include N or U or P, so any form of these letters will usually sug- FIG. 10.20 Digital reading capacitance meter.

Let us now extend this discussion to include the potentials and current developed within the network of Fig. 10.24 following the closing of the switch (to position 1). You will recall that the instant the switch is closed, electrons are drawn from the top plate and deposited on the bottom plate by the bat- tery, resulting in a net positive charge on the top plate and a negative charge on the bottom plate. The transfer of electrons is very rapid at ﬁrst, slowing down as the potential across the capacitor approaches the applied voltage of the battery. When the voltage across the capacitor equals the battery voltage, the transfer of electrons will cease and the plates will have a net charge determined by Q \u0001 CVC \u0001 CE. Plots of the changing current and voltage appear in Figs. 10.25 and 10.26, respectively. When the switch is closed at t \u0001 0 s, the current jumps to a value limited only by the resistance of the network and then decays to zero as the plates are charged. Note the rapid decay in current level, revealing that the amount of charge deposited on the plates per unit time is rapidly decaying also. Since the voltage across the plates is directly related to the charge on the plates by vC \u0001 q/C, the rapid rate with which charge is initially deposited on the plates will result in a rapid increase in vC. Obviously, as the rate of ﬂow of charge (I) decreases, the rate of change in voltage will follow suit. Eventually, the ﬂow of charge will stop, the current I will be zero, and the voltage will cease to change in magnitude—the charging phase has passed. At this point the capacitor takes on the characteristics of an open circuit: a volt- age drop across the plates without a ﬂow of charge “between” the plates. As demonstrated in Fig. 10.27, the voltage across the capacitor is the source voltage since i \u0001 iC \u0001 iR \u0001 0 A and vR \u0001 iRR \u0001 (0)R \u0001 0 V. For all future analysis: A capacitor can be replaced by an open-circuit equivalent once the charging phase in a dc network has passed. Looking back at the instant the switch is closed, we can also surmise that a capacitor behaves as a short circuit the moment the switch is closed in a dc charging network, as shown in Fig. 10.28.

A plot of e \u0004x for x ≥ 0 appears in Fig. 10.29. Exponentials are mathematical functions that all students of electrical, electronic, or computer systems must become very famil- iar with. They will appear throughout the analysis to follow in this course, and in succeeding courses. Our current interest in the function e \u0004x is limited to values of x greater than zero, as noted by the curve of Fig. 10.25. All modern-day scientiﬁc calculators have the function e x. To obtain e \u0004x, the sign of x must be changed using the sign key before the exponential function is keyed in. The magnitude of e \u0004x has been listed in Table 10.3 for a range of values of x.

Thus, (seconds, s) (10.14) If we substitute t \u0001 RC into the exponential function e \u0004t/RC, we obtain e \u0004t/t.In one time constant, e \u0004t/t \u0001 e \u0004t/t \u0001 e \u00041 \u0001 0.3679, or the function equals 36.79% of its maximum value of 1.

The magnitude of e \u0004t/t and the percentage change between time con- stants have been tabulated in Tables 10.4 and 10.5, respectively. Note that the current has dropped 63.2% (100% \u0004 36.8%) in the ﬁrst time constant but only 0.4% between the ﬁfth and sixth time constants. The rate of change of iC is therefore quite sensitive to the time constant determined by the network parameters R and C. For this reason, the uni- versal time constant chart of Fig. 10.30 is provided to permit a more accurate estimate of the value of the function e \u0004x for speciﬁc time inter- vals related to the time constant. The term universal is used because the axes are not scaled to speciﬁc values. t \u0001 RC Q \u0002 V V\u0002 Q/t Q \u0002 V V \u0002 I 392  CAPACITORS Returning to Eq. (10.13), we ﬁnd that the multiplying factor E/R is the maximum value that the current iC can attain, as shown in Fig. 10.25. Substituting t \u0001 0 s into Eq. (10.13) yields iC \u0001 e \u0004t/RC \u0001 \u0002 E R \u0002e \u00040 \u0001 \u0002 E R \u0002 verifying our earlier conclusion. For increasing values of t, the magnitude of e \u0004t/t, and therefore the value of iC, will decrease, as shown in Fig. 10.31. Since the magnitude of iC is less than 1% of its maximum after ﬁve time constants, we will assume the following for future analysis: The current iC of a capacitive network is essentially zero after ﬁve time constants of the charging phase have passed in a dc network. Since C is usually found in microfarads or picofarads, the time con- stant t \u0001 RC will never be greater than a few seconds unless R is very large. Let us now turn our attention to the charging voltage across the capacitor. Through further mathematical analysis, the following equa- tion for the voltage across the capacitor can be determined: (10.15) Note the presence of the same factor e \u0004t/RC and the function (1 \u0004 e \u0004t/RC) appearing in Fig. 10.30. Since e \u0004t/t is a decaying function, the factor (1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) will grow toward a maximum value of 1 with time, as shown in Fig. 10.30. In addition, since E is the multiplying factor, we can conclude that, for all practical purposes, the voltage vC is E volts vC \u0001 E(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/RC) E \u0002 R 36.8% 13.5% 5% 1.8% 01 2 3 45 t iC = 0.67% E R e –t/ E R iC \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003\u0003 \u0003 FIG. 10.31 iC versus t during the charging phase. 0 1\u0003 2\u0003 3\u0003 4\u0003 5\u0003 6\u0003 1.0 y 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 1\u0003 y = e–t/\u0003 y = 1 – e –t/\u0003 0.368 (close to )1 3 0.632 (close to )2 3 t \u0003 \u0003\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 FIG. 10.30 Universal time constant chart.

If we keep R constant and reduce C, the product RC will decrease, and the rise time of ﬁve time constants will decrease. The change in transient behavior of the voltage vC is plotted in Fig. 10.33 for various values of C. The product RC will always have some numerical value, even though it may be very small in some cases. For this reason: The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously. In fact, the capacitance of a network is also a measure of how much it will oppose a change in voltage across the network. The larger the capacitance, the larger the time constant, and the longer it takes to charge up to its ﬁnal value (curve of C3 in Fig. 10.33). A lesser capaci- tance would permit the voltage to build up more quickly since the time constant is less (curve of C1 in Fig. 10.33). The rate at which charge is deposited on the plates during the charg- ing phase can be found by substituting the following for vC in Eq. (10.15): vC \u0001 and charging (10.16) indicating that the charging rate is very high during the ﬁrst few time constants and less than 1% after ﬁve time constants.

If the switch of Fig. 10.24 is opened, as shown in Fig. 10.37(a), the capacitor will retain its charge for a period of time determined by its leakage current. For capacitors such as the mica and ceramic, the leak- age current (ileakage \u0001 vC /Rleakage) is very small, enabling the capacitor to retain its charge, and hence the potential difference across its plates, for a long time. For electrolytic capacitors, which have very high leak- age currents, the capacitor will discharge more rapidly, as shown in Fig. 10.37(b). In any event, to ensure that they are completely discharged, capacitors should be shorted by a lead or a screwdriver before they are handled. 40 V\u0002 8 k\u0005 R + – vR = 0 V 1 2 E i = 0 vC E (a) 2 vR = 0 V i = 0 + – vC Rleakage ileakage (b) 2 – vR + + – vC R = E iC = iR = idischarge FIG. 10.37 Effect of the leakage current on the steady-state behavior of a capacitor.

When the switch is placed in position 1, the capacitor will charge toward the supply voltage, as described in the last section. At any point in the charging process, if the switch is moved to position 2, the capacitor will begin to discharge at a rate sensitive to the same time constant t \u0001 RC. The established voltage across the capacitor will cre- ate a ﬂow of charge in the closed path that will eventually discharge the capacitor completely. In essence, the capacitor functions like a battery with a decreasing terminal voltage. Note in particular that the current iC has reversed direction, changing the polarity of the voltage across R. If the capacitor had charged to the full battery voltage as indicated in Fig. 10.38, the equation for the decaying voltage across the capacitor would be the following: discharging (10.18)vC \u0001 Ee\u0004t/RC DISCHARGE PHASE  395 which employs the function e \u0004x and the same time constant used above. The resulting curve will have the same shape as the curve for iC and vR in the last section. During the discharge phase, the current iC will also decrease with time, as deﬁned by the following equation: discharging (10.19) The voltage vR \u0001 vC, and discharging (10.20) The complete discharge will occur, for all practical purposes, in ﬁve time constants. If the switch is moved between terminals 1 and 2 every ﬁve time constants, the wave shapes of Fig. 10.39 will result for vC, iC, and vR. For each curve, the current direction and voltage polarities were deﬁned by Fig. 10.24. Since the polarity of vC is the same for both the charging and the discharging phases, the entire curve lies above the axis. The current iC reverses direction during the charging and dis- charging phases, producing a negative pulse for both the current and the voltage vR. Note that the voltage vC never changes magnitude instanta- neously but that the current iC has the ability to change instantaneously, as demonstrated by its vertical rises and drops to maximum values. vR \u0001 Ee \u0004t/RC iC \u0001 \u0002 E R \u0002e \u0004t/RC E vC 0 tPos. 1 15tPos. 2 Pos. 1 Pos. 2 E iC 0 tPos. 1 Pos. 2 Pos. 1 Pos. 2 R E vR 0 tPos. 1 Pos. 2 Pos. 1 Pos. 2 E R 10t5t Charging Discharging 5t 15t 5t 15t – E – 10t 10t FIG. 10.39 The charging and discharging cycles for the network of Fig. 10.24. 8 k\u0002 2 – vR + + – vC R = E = 40 V iC C 4 F\u0004 FIG. 10.40 Example 10.6.

The preceding discussion and examples apply to situations in which the capacitor charges to the battery voltage. If the charging phase is dis- rupted before reaching the supply voltage, the capacitive voltage will be less, and the equation for the discharging voltage vC will take on the form (10.21) where Vi is the starting or initial voltage for the discharge phase. The equation for the decaying current is also modiﬁed by simply substitut- ing Vi for E; that is, (10.22) Use of the above equations will be demonstrated in Examples 10.7 and 10.8. EXAMPLE 10.7 a.

We will now examine the effect of a charge, and therefore a voltage (V \u0001 Q/C), on the plates at the instant the switching action takes place. The voltage across the capacitor at this instant is called the initial value, as shown for the gen- eral waveform of Fig. 10.48. Once the switch is thrown, the transient FIG. 10.47 The waveforms for the network of Fig. 10.44. 400  CAPACITORS Initial conditions Vi Transient response Steady-state region Vf 0 t vC FIG. 10.48 Deﬁning the regions associated with a transient response. phase will commence until a leveling off occurs after ﬁve time constants. This region of relatively ﬁxed value that follows the transient response is called the steady-state region, and the resulting value is called the steady-state or ﬁnal value. The steady-state value is found by simply substituting the open-circuit equivalent for the capacitor and ﬁnding the voltage across the plates. Using the transient equation developed in the previous section, an equation for the voltage vC can be written for the entire time interval of Fig. 10.48; that is, vC \u0001 Vi \u0006 (Vf \u0004 Vi)(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) However, by multiplying through and rearranging terms: vC \u0001 Vi \u0006 Vf \u0004 Vf e \u0004t/t \u0004 Vi \u0006 Vi e \u0004t/t \u0001 Vf \u0004 Vf e \u0004t/t \u0006 Vi e \u0004t/t we ﬁnd (10.23) If you are required to draw the waveform for the voltage vC from the initial value to the ﬁnal value, start by drawing a line at the initial and steady-state levels, and then add the transient response (sensitive to the time constant) between the two levels. The example to follow will clar- ify the procedure.

Find the mathematical expression for the current during the transient period. c. Sketch the waveform for each from initial value to ﬁnal value. Solutions: a. Substituting the open-circuit equivalent for the capacitor will result in a ﬁnal or steady-state voltage vC of 24 V. The time constant is determined by t \u0001 (R1 \u0006 R2)C \u0001 (2.2 k\u0005\u0006 1.2 k\u0005)(3.3 mF) \u0001 11.22 ms with 5t \u0001 56.1 ms Applying Eq.

Since the voltage across the capacitor is constant at 4 V prior to the closing of the switch, the current (whose level is sensitive only to changes in voltage across the capacitor) must have an initial value of 0 mA. At the instant the switch is closed, the voltage across the capacitor cannot change instantaneously, so the voltage across the resistive elements at this instant is the applied voltage less the initial voltage across the capacitor. The resulting peak current is Im \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 5.88 mA The current will then decay (with the same time constant as the voltage vC) to zero because the capacitor is approaching its open- circuit equivalence. The equation for iC is therefore: iC \u0001 5.88 mAe \u0002t/11.22ms c.

For the current, the waveform begins and ends at zero, with the peak value having a sign sensitive to the deﬁned direction of iC in Fig. 10.49. Let us now test the validity of the equation for vC by substituting t \u0001 0 s to reﬂect the instant the switch is closed. e \u0004t/t \u0001 e \u00040 \u0001 1 and vC \u0001 24 V \u0004 20 Ve \u0004t/t \u0001 24 V \u0004 20 V \u0001 4 V When t \b 5t, e \u0004t/t \u0002 0 and vC \u0001 24 V \u0004 20 Ve \u0004t/t \u0001 24 V \u0004 0 V \u0001 24 V 10.10 INSTANTANEOUS VALUES On occasion it will be necessary to determine the voltage or current at a particular instant of time that is not an integral multiple of t, as in the previous sections. For example, if vC \u0001 20(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/(2\u000310\u00043)) the voltage vC may be required at t \u0001 5 ms, which does not correspond to a particular value of t. Figure 10.30 reveals that (1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) is approximately 0.93 at t \u0001 5 ms \u0001 2.5t, resulting in vC \u0001 20(0.93) \u0001 18.6 V. Additional accuracy can be obtained simply by substituting t \u0001 5 ms into the equation and solving for vC using a calculator or table to determine e \u00042.5. Thus, vC \u0001 20(1 \u0004 e \u00045ms/2ms) \u0001 20(1 \u0004 e \u00042.5) \u0001 20(1 \u0004 0.082) \u0001 20(0.918) \u0001 18.36 V The results are close, but accuracy beyond the tenths place is suspect using Fig. 10.30. The above procedure can also be applied to any other equation introduced in this chapter for currents or other voltages. There are also occasions when the time to reach a particular voltage or current is required. The procedure is complicated somewhat by the use of natural logs (loge, or ln), but today’s calculators are equipped to handle the operation with ease. There are two forms that require some development. First, consider the following sequence: vC \u0001 E(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0001 1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t 1 \u0004 \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0001 e \u0004t/t loge\u00031 \u0004 \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0004 \u0001 logee \u0004t/t loge\u00031 \u0004 \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0004 \u0001\u0004 t \u0002 t INSTANTANEOUS VALUES  403 and t \u0001\u0004t loge\u00031 \u0004 \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0004 but \u0004loge\u0002 x y \u0002\u0001\u0006loge\u0002 y x \u0002 Therefore, t \u0001 t loge\u0003\u0002 E \u0004 E vC \u0002 \u0004 (10.24) The second form is as follows: vC \u0001 Ee \u0004t/t \u0002 v E C \u0002\u0001 e \u0004t/t loge\u0002 v E C \u0002\u0001 logee \u0004t/t loge\u0002 v E C \u0002\u0001\u0004 and t \u0001\u0004t loge\u0002 v E C \u0002 or t \u0001 t loge\u0002 v E C \u0002 (10.25) For iC \u0001 (E/R)e \u0004t/t: t \u0001 t loge\u0002 iC E R \u0002 (10.26) For example, suppose that vC \u0001 20(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/(2\u000310\u00043)) and the time to reach 10 V is required. Substituting into Eq. (10.24), we have t \u0001 (2 ms)loge\u0003\u0004 \u0001 (2 ms)loge2 \u0001 (2 ms)(0.693) \u0001 1.386 ms Using Fig. 10.30, we ﬁnd at (1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) \u0001 vC /E \u0001 0.5 that t \u0002 0.7t \u0001 0.7(2 ms) \u0001 1.4 ms, which is relatively close to the above. Mathcad It is time to see how Mathcad can be applied to the transient analysis described in this chapter. For the ﬁrst equation described in Section 10.10, vC \u0001 20(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/(2\u000310\u00043)) the value of t must be deﬁned before the expression is written, or the value can simply be inserted in the equation. The former approach is 20 V\u0002\u0002 20 V \u0004 10 V t \u0002 t key on calculatorINF 404  CAPACITORS often better because changing the deﬁned value of t will result in an immediate change in the result. In other words, the value can be used for further calculations. In Fig. 10.51 the value of t was deﬁned as 5 ms. The equation was then entered using the e function from the Calcula- tor palette obtained from View-Toolbars-Calculator. Be sure to insert a multiplication operator between the initial 20 and the main left bracket. Also, be careful that the control bracket is in the correct place before placing the right bracket to enclose the equation. It will take some practice to ensure that the insertion bracket is in the correct place before entering a parameter, but in time you will ﬁnd that it is a fairly direct procedure. The \u00013 is placed using the shift operator over the number 6 on the standard keyboard. The result is displayed by simply entering v again, followed by an equal sign. The result for t \u0001 1 ms can now be obtained by simply changing the deﬁned value for t. The result of 7.869 V will appear immediately. FIG. 10.51 Applying Mathcad to the transient R-C equations. For the second equation of Section 10.10, vC \u0001 20(1 \u0002 e \u00025ms/2ms) the equation for t can be entered directly as shown in the bottom of Fig. 10.51. The ln from the Calculator is for a base e calculation, while log is for a base 10 calculation. The result will appear the instant the equal sign is placed after the t on the bottom line. The text you see on the screen to deﬁne each operation is obtained by clicking on Insert-Text Region and then simply typing in the text material. The boldface was obtained by simply clicking on the text material and swiping the text to establish a black background. Then select B from the toolbar, and the boldface will appear.

The function dvC /dt is called the derivative of the volt- age vC with respect to time t. If the voltage fails to change at a particular instant, then dvC \u0001 0 and iC \u0001 C \u0005 d d v t C \u0005 \u0001 0 In other words, if the voltage across a capacitor fails to change with time, the current iC associated with the capacitor is zero. To take this a step further, the equation also states that the more rapid the change in voltage across the capacitor, the greater the resulting current. In an effort to develop a clearer understanding of Eq. (10.27), let us calculate the average current associated with a capacitor for various voltages impressed across the capacitor. The average current is deﬁned by the equation (10.28) where \u0007 indicates a ﬁnite (measurable) change in charge, voltage, or time. The instantaneous current can be derived from Eq. (10.28) by let- ting \u0007t become vanishingly small; that is, iCinst \u0001 lim ∆t→0 C \u0005 \u0007 \u0007 v t C \u0005 \u0001 C \u0005 d d v t C \u0005 In the following example, the change in voltage \u0007vC will be consid- ered for each slope of the voltage waveform. If the voltage increases with time, the average current is the change in voltage divided by the change in time, with a positive sign. If the voltage decreases with time, the average current is again the change in voltage divided by the change in time, but with a negative sign. EXAMPLE 10.13 Find the waveform for the average current if the voltage across a 2-mF capacitor is as shown in Fig. 10.59. Solutions: a.

From 2 ms to 5 ms, the voltage remains constant at 4 V; the change in voltage \u0007v \u0001 0.

The change in voltage \u0007v is, therefore, 4 V \u0002 0 \u0001 4V (with a negative sign since the voltage is decreasing with time). The change in time \u0007t \u0001 11 ms \u0002 5ms \u0001 6 ms, and iCav \u0001 C \u0005 \u0007 \u0007 v t C \u0005 \u0001\u0002(2 \u0006 10 \u00026 F)\u0002\u0003 \u0001\u00021.33 \u0006 10 \u00023 A \u0001\u00021.33 mA d. From 11 ms on, the voltage remains constant at 0 and \u0007v \u0001 0, so iCav \u0001 0. The waveform for the average current for the impressed voltage is as shown in Fig. 10.60. 4 V\u0005\u0005 6 \u0006 10 \u00023 s Note in Example 10.13 that, in general, the steeper the slope, the greater the current, and when the voltage fails to change, the current is zero. In addition, the average value is the same as the instantaneous value at any point along the slope over which the average value was found. For example, if the interval \u0007t is reduced from 0 → t1 to t2 \u0002 t3, as noted in Fig. 10.59, \u0007v/\u0007t is still the same. In fact, no matter how small the interval \u0007t, the slope will be the same, and therefore the cur- rent iCav will be the same. If we consider the limit as \u0007t → 0, the slope will still remain the same, and therefore iCav \u0001 iCinst at any instant of iC (mA) 0 t (ms)9 10 11 12 4 56 7 81 23 4 –1.33 FIG. 10.60 The resulting current iC for the applied voltage of Fig. 10.59. 410  CAPACITORS time between 0 and t1. The same can be said about any portion of the voltage waveform that has a constant slope. An important point to be gained from this discussion is that it is not the magnitude of the voltage across a capacitor that determines the cur- rent but rather how quickly the voltage changes across the capacitor. An applied steady dc voltage of 10,000 V would (ideally) not create any ﬂow of charge (current), but a change in voltage of 1 V in a very brief period of time could create a signiﬁcant current. The method described above is only for waveforms with straight-line (linear) segments. For nonlinear (curved) waveforms, a method of cal- culus (differentiation) must be employed. 10.13 CAPACITORS IN SERIES AND PARALLEL Capacitors, like resistors, can be placed in series and in parallel. Increasing levels of capacitance can be obtained by placing capacitors in parallel, while decreasing levels can be obtained by placing capaci- tors in series. For capacitors in series, the charge is the same on each capacitor (Fig. 10.61): (10.29) Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop gives E \u0001 V1 \u0003 V2 \u0003 V3 However, V \u0001 \u0005 Q C \u0005 so that \u0001\u0003\u0003 Using Eq.

Two con- ducting wires in the same network will have a capacitive effect between them, as shown in Fig. 10.71(a). In electronic circuits, capacitance lev- els exist between conducting surfaces of the transistor, as shown in Fig. 10.71(b). As mentioned earlier, in Chapter 12 we will discuss another element called the inductor, which will have capacitive effects between the windings [Fig. 10.71(c)]. Stray capacitances can often lead to seri- ous errors in system design if they are not considered carefully. 10.16 APPLICATIONS This Applications section for capacitors includes both a description of the operation of one of the less expensive, throwaway cameras that have become so popular today and a discussion of the use of capacitors in the line conditioners (surge protectors) that have found their way into most homes and throughout the business world. Additional examples of the use of capacitors will appear throughout the chapter to follow.

APPLICATIONS  415 Flash Lamp The basic circuitry for the ﬂash lamp of the popular, inexpensive, throwaway camera of Fig. 10.72(a) is provided in Fig. 10.72(b), with the physical circuitry appearing in Fig. 10.72(c). The labels added to Fig. 10.72(c) identify broad areas of the design and some individual components. The major components of the electronic circuitry include a large 160-mF, 330-V, polarized electrolytic capacitor to store the nec- essary charge for the ﬂash lamp, a ﬂash lamp to generate the required light, a dc battery of 1.5 V, a chopper network to generate a dc voltage in excess of 300 V, and a trigger network to establish a few thousand volts for a very short period of time to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp. There are both a 22-nF capacitor in the trigger network as shown in Fig. 10.72(b) and (c) and a third capacitor of 470 pF in the high-frequency oscillator of the chopper network. In particular, note that the size of each capaci- tor is directly related to its capacitance level. It should certainly be of some interest that a single source of energy of only 1.5 V dc can be con- verted to one of a few thousand volts (albeit for a very short period of time) to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp. In fact, that single, small battery has sufﬁ- cient power for the entire run of ﬁlm through the camera. Always keep in mind that energy is related to power and time by W \u0001 Pt \u0001 (VI)t. \u0000\u0001\u0002 FIG. 10.72(a) Flash camera: general appearance.

That is, a high level of voltage can be generated for a deﬁned energy level so long as the factors I and t are sufﬁciently small. When you ﬁrst use the camera, you are directed to press the ﬂash button on the face of the camera and wait for the ﬂash-ready light to come on. As soon as the ﬂash button is depressed, the full 1.5 V of the dc battery are applied to an electronic network (a variety of networks can perform the same function) that will generate an oscillating wave- form of very high frequency (with a high repetitive rate) as shown in Fig. 10.72(b). The high-frequency transformer will then signiﬁcantly increase the magnitude of the generated voltage and will pass it on to a half-wave rectiﬁcation system (introduced in earlier chapters), resulting in a dc voltage of about 300 V across the 160-mF capacitor to charge the capacitor (as determined by Q \u0001 CV). Once the 300-V level is reached, the lead marked “sense” in Fig. 10.72(b) will feed the information back to the oscillator and will turn it off until the output dc voltage drops to a low threshold level. When the capacitor is fully charged, the neon light in parallel with the capacitor will turn on (labeled “ﬂash-ready lamp” on the camera) to let you know that the camera is ready to use. The entire network from the 1.5-V dc level to the ﬁnal 300-V level is called a dc-dc converter. The terminology chopper network comes from the fact that the applied dc voltage of 1.5 V was chopped up into one that changes level at a very high frequency so that the transformer can perform its function. Even though the camera may use a 60-V neon light, the neon light and series resistor Rn must have a full 300 V across the branch before the neon light will turn on. Neon lights are simply bulbs with a neon gas that will support conduction when the voltage across the terminals reaches a sufﬁciently high level. There is no ﬁlament, or hot wire as in a light bulb, but simply conduction through the gaseous medium. For new cameras the ﬁrst charging sequence may take 12 s to 15 s. Suc- ceeding charging cycles may only take some 7 s or 8 s because the capacitor will still have some residual charge on its plates. If the ﬂash unit is not used, the neon light will begin to drain the 300-V dc supply with a drain current in microamperes. As the terminal voltage drops, there will come a point where the neon light will turn off. For the unit of Fig. 10.72, it takes about 15 min before the light turns off. Once off, the neon light will no longer drain the capacitor, and the terminal volt- age of the capacitor will remain fairly constant. Eventually, however, the capacitor will discharge due to its own leakage current, and the ter- minal voltage will drop to very low levels. The discharge process is very rapid when the ﬂash unit is used, causing the terminal voltage to drop very quickly (V \u0001 Q/C) and, through the feedback-sense connec- tion signal, causing the oscillator to start up again and recharge the capacitor. You may have noticed when using a camera of this type that once the camera has its initial charge, there is no need to press the charge button between pictures—it is done automatically. However, if the camera sits for a long period of time, the charge button will have to be depressed again; but you will ﬁnd that the charge time is only 3 s or 4 s due to the residual charge on the plates of the capacitor. The 300 V across the capacitor are insufﬁcient to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp. Additional circuitry, called the trigger network, must be incorporated to generate the few thousand volts necessary to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp. The resulting high voltage is one reason that there is a CAUTION note on each camera regarding the high internal voltages generated and the pos- sibility of electrical shock if the camera is opened. The thousands of volts required to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp require a dis- cussion that introduces elements and concepts beyond the current level of the text. However, this description is sensitive to this fact and should be looked upon as simply a ﬁrst exposure to some of the interesting possibilities available from the right mix of elements. When the ﬂash switch at the bottom left of Fig. 10.72(a) is closed, it will establish a connection between the resistors R1 and R2. Through a voltage divider action, a dc voltage will appear at the gate (G) terminal of the SCR (silicon-controlled rectiﬁer—a device whose state is controlled by the voltage at the gate terminal). This dc voltage will turn the SCR “on” and will establish a very low resistance path (like a short circuit) between its anode (A) and cathode (K) terminals. At this point the trig- ger capacitor, which is connected directly to the 300 V sitting across the capacitor, will rapidly charge to 300 V because it now has a direct, low- resistance path to ground through the SCR. Once it reaches 300 V, the charging current in this part of the network will drop to 0 A, and the APPLICATIONS  417418  CAPACITORS SCR will open up again since it is a device that needs a steady current in the anode circuit to stay on. The capacitor then sits across the paral- lel coil (with no connection to ground through the SCR) with its full 300 V and begins to quickly discharge through the coil because the only resistance in the circuit affecting the time constant is the resistance of the parallel coil. As a result, a rapidly changing current through the coil will generate a high voltage across the coil for reasons to be introduced in Chapter 12. When the capacitor decays to zero volts, the current through the coil will be zero amperes, but a strong magnetic ﬁeld has been established around the coil. This strong magnetic ﬁeld will then quickly collapse, establishing a current in the parallel network that will recharge the capacitor again. This continual exchange between the two storage ele- ments will continue for a period of time, depending on the resistance in the ciruit. The more the resistance, the shorter the “ringing” of the volt- age at the output. This action of the energy “ﬂying back” to the other element is the basis for the “ﬂyback” effect that is frequently used to generate high dc voltages such as needed in TVs. In Fig. 10.72(b), you will ﬁnd that the trigger coil is connected directly to a second coil to form an autotransformer (a transformer with one end connected). Through transformer action the high voltage generated across the trig- ger coil will be increased further, resulting in the 4000 V necessary to ﬁre the ﬂash lamp. Note in Fig. 10.72(c) that the 4000 V are applied to a grid that actually lies on the surface of the glass tube of the ﬂash lamp (not internally connected or in contact with the gases). When the trig- ger voltage is applied, it will excite the gases in the lamp, causing a very high current to develop in the bulb for a very short period of time and producing the desired bright light. The current in the lamp is sup- ported by the charge on the 160-mF capacitor which will be dissipated very quickly. The capacitor voltage will drop very quickly, the photo lamp will shut down, and the charging process will begin again. If the entire process didn’t occur as quickly as it does, the lamp would burn out after a single use. Line Conditioner (Surge Protector) In recent years we have all become familiar with the line conditioner as a safety measure for our computers, TVs, CD players, and other sensi- tive instrumentation. In addition to protecting equipment from unex- pected surges in voltage and current, most quality units will also ﬁlter out (remove) electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio-frequency interference (RFI). EMI encompasses any unwanted disturbances down the power line established by any combination of electromagnetic effects such as those generated by motors on the line, power equipment in the area emitting signals picked up by the power line acting as an antenna, and so on. RFI includes all signals in the air in the audio range and beyond which may also be picked up by power lines inside or out- side the house. The unit of Fig. 10.73 has all the design features expected in a good line conditioner. Figure 10.73(a) reveals that it can handle the power drawn by six outlets and that it is set up for FAX/MODEM protection. Also note that it has both LED (light-emitting diode) displays which reveal whether there is fault on the line or whether the line is OK and an external circuit breaker to reset the system. In addition, when the surge protector is on, a red light will be visible at the power switch. \u0000\u0001\u0002 FIG. 10.73(a) Line conditioner: general appearance.

Line conditioner: (b) electrical schematic; (c) internal construction. The schematic of Fig. 10.73(b) does not include all the details of the design, but it does include the major components that appear in most good line conditioners. First note in the photograph of Fig. 10.73(c) that the outlets are all connected in parallel, with a ground bar used to estab- lish a ground connection for each outlet. The circuit board had to be ﬂipped over to show the components, so it will take some adjustment to relate the position of the elements on the board to the casing. The feed line or hot lead wire (black in the actual unit) is connected directly from the line to the circuit breaker. The other end of the circuit breaker is con- nected to the other side of the circuit board. All the large discs that you see are 2-nF/73 capacitors [not all have been included in Fig 10.73(b) for clarity]. There are quite a few capacitors to handle all the possibilities. For instance, there are capacitors from line to return (black wire to white wire), from line to ground (black to green), and from return to ground (white to ground). Each has two functions. The ﬁrst and most obvious function is to prevent any spikes in voltage that may come down the line because of external effects such as lightning from reaching the equip- ment plugged into the unit. Recall from this chapter that the voltage across capacitors cannot change instantaneously and in fact will act to squelch any rapid change in voltage across its terminals. The capacitor, therefore, will prevent the line to neutral voltage from changing too quickly, and any spike that tries to come down the line will have to ﬁnd another point in the feed circuit to fall across. In this way the appliances to the surge protector are well protected. The second function requires some knowledge of the reaction of capacitors to different frequencies and will be discussed in more detail in later chapters. For the moment, let it sufﬁce to say that the capaci- tor will have a different impedance to different frequencies, thereby preventing undesired frequencies, such as those associated with EMI and RFI disturbances, from affecting the operation of units connected to the line conditioner. The rectangular-shaped capacitor of 1 mF near the center of the board is connected directly across the line to take the brunt of a strong voltage spike down the line. Its larger size is clear evidence that it is designed to absorb a fairly high energy level that may be estab- lished by a large voltage—signiﬁcant current over a period of time that might exceed a few milliseconds. The large, toroidal-shaped structure in the center of the circuit board of Fig. 10.73(c) has two coils (Chapter 12) of 228 mH that appear in the line and neutral of Fig. 10.73(b). Their purpose, like that of the capaci- tors, is twofold: to block spikes in current from coming down the line and to block unwanted EMI and RFI frequencies from getting to the connected systems. In the next chapter you will ﬁnd that coils act as “chokes” to quick changes in current; that is, the current through a coil cannot change instantaneously. For increasing frequencies, such as those associated with EMI and RFI disturbances, the reactance of a coil increases and will absorb the undesired signal rather than let it pass down the line. Using a choke in both the line and the neutral makes the conditioner network balanced to ground. In total, capacitors in a line conditioner have the effect of bypassing the disturbances, whereas inductors block the disturbance. The smaller disc (blue) between two capacitors and near the circuit breaker is an MOV (metal-oxide varistor) which is the heart of most line conditioners. It is an electronic device whose terminal characteris- tics will change with the voltage applied across its terminals. For the normal range of voltages down the line, its terminal resistance will be 420  CAPACITORS COMPUTER ANALYSIS  421 sufﬁciently large to be considered an open circuit, and its presence can be ignored. However, if the voltage is too large, its terminal character- istics will change from a very large resistance to a very small resistance that can essentially be considered a short circuit. This variation in resis- tance with applied voltage is the reason for the name varistor. For MOVs in North America where the line voltage is 120 V, the MOVs are 180 V or more. The reason for the 60-V difference is that the 120-V rat- ing is an effective value related to dc voltage levels, whereas the wave- form for the voltage at any 120-V outlet has a peak value of about 170 V. A great deal more will be said about this topic in Chapter 13. Taking a look at the symbol for an MOV in Fig. 10.73(b), you will note that it has an arrow in each direction, revealing that the MOV is bidirectional and will block voltages with either polarity. In general, therefore, for normal operating conditions, the presence of the MOV can be ignored; but, if a large spike should appear down the line, exceeding the MOV rating, it will act as a short across the line to pro- tect the connected circuitry. It is a signiﬁcant improvement to simply putting a fuse in the line because it is voltage sensitive, can react much quicker than a fuse, and will display its low-resistance characteristics for only a short period of time. When the spike has passed, it will return to its normal open-circuit characteristic. If you’re wondering where the spike will go if the load is protected by a short circuit, remember that all sources of disturbance, such as lightning, generators, inductive motors (such as in air conditioners, dishwashers, power saws, and so on), have their own “source resistance,” and there is always some resis- tance down the line to absorb the disturbance. Most line conditioners, as part of their advertising, like to mention their energy absorption level. The rating of the unit of Fig. 10.73 is 1200 J which is actually higher than most. Remembering that W \u0001 Pt \u0001 EIt from the earlier discussion of cameras, we now realize that if a 5000-V spike came down the line, we would be left with the product It \u0001 W/E \u0001 1200 J/5000 V \u0001 240 mAs. Assuming a linear relationship between all quantities, the rated energy level is revealing that a current of 100 A could be sustained for t \u0001 240 mAs/100 A \u0001 2.4 ms, a cur- rent of 1000 A for 240 ms, and a current of 10,000 A for 24 ms. Obvi- ously, the higher the power product of E and I, the less the time ele- ment. The technical speciﬁcations of the unit of Fig. 10.73 include an instantaneous response time of 0 ns (questionable), with a phone line protection of 5 ns. The unit is rated to dissipate surges up to 6000 V and current spikes up to 96,000 A. It has a very high noise suppression ratio (80 dB; see Chapter 23) at frequencies from 50 kHz to 1000 MHz, and (a credit to the company) it has a lifetime warranty. 10.17 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Transient RC Response PSpice will now investigate the transient response for the voltage across the capacitor of Fig. 10.74. In all the examples in the text involving a transient response, a switch appeared in series with the source as shown in Fig. 10.75(a). When applying PSpice, we establish this instantaneous change in voltage level by R 5 k\u0001 20 VE C iC 8 µF + – vC FIG. 10.74 Circuit to be analyzed using PSpice. 422  CAPACITORS applying a pulse waveform as shown in Fig. 10.75(b) with a pulse width (PW) longer than the period (5t) of interest for the network. A pulse source is obtained through the sequence Place part key- Libraries-SOURCE-VPULSE-OK. Once in place, the label and all the parameters can be set by simply double-clicking on each to obtain the Display Properties dialog box. As you scroll down the list of attri- butes, you will see the following parameters deﬁned by Fig. 10.76: V1 is the initial value. V2 is the pulse level. TD is the delay time. TR is the rise time. TF is the fall time. PW is the pulse width at the V2 level. PER is the period of the waveform. All the parameters have been set as shown on the schematic of Fig. 10.77 for the network of Fig. 10.74. Since a rise and fall time of 0 s is unrealistic from a practical standpoint, 0.1 ms was chosen for each in this example. Further, since t \u0001 RC \u0001 (5 k\u0004) \u0006 (8 mF) \u0001 20 ms and 5t \u0001 200 ms, a pulse width of 500 ms was selected. The period was simply chosen as twice the pulse width. Now for the simulation process. First the New Simulation Proﬁle key is selected to obtain the New Simulation dialog box in which TransientRC is inserted for the Name and Create is chosen to leave the dialog box. The Simulation Settings-Transient RC dialog box will result, and under Analysis, the Time Domain (Transient) option is chosen under Analysis type. The Run to time is set at 200 ms so that only the ﬁrst ﬁve time constants will be plotted. The Start saving data after option will be 0 s to ensure that the data are collected immedi- ately. The Maximum step size is 1 ms to provide sufﬁcient data points for a good plot. Click OK, and we are ready to select the Run PSpice key. The result will be a graph without a plot (since it has not been deﬁned yet) and an x-axis that extends from 0 s to 200 ms as deﬁned above. To obtain a plot of the voltage across the capacitor versus time, the following sequence is applied: Add Trace key-Add Traces dialog box-V1(C)-OK, and the plot of Fig. 10.78 will result. The color and thickness of the plot and the axis can be changed by placing the cursor on the plot line and performing a right click. A list will appear in which Properties should be selected; then a Trace Properties dialog box will appear in which the color and thickness of the line can be changed. Since the plot is against a black background, a better printout occurred when yellow was selected and the line was made thicker as shown in Fig. 10.78. Next, the cursor can be put on the axis, and another right click will allow you to make the axis yellow and thicker for a better printout. For comparison it seemed appropriate to plot the applied pulse signal also. This is accomplished by going back to Trace and selecting Add Trace followed by V(Vpulse:\u0004) and OK. Now both waveforms appear on the same screen as shown in Fig. 10.78. In this case, the plot was left a greenish tint so it could be distinguished from the axis and the other plot. Note that it follows the left axis to the top and travels across the screen at 20 V. If you want the magnitude of either plot at any instant, simply select the Toggle cursor key. Then click on V1(C) at the bottom left of the screen. A box will appear around V1(C) that will reveal the spacing between the dots of the cursor on the screen.

By moving the cursor to 200 ms, we ﬁnd that the magnitude (A1) is 19.865 V (in the Probe Cursor dialog box), clearly showing how close it is to the ﬁnal value of 20 V. A second cur- sor can be placed on the screen with a right click and then a click on the same V1(C) on the bottom of the screen. The box around V1(C) cannot show two boxes, but the spacing and the width of the lines of the box have deﬁnitely changed. There is no box around the Pulse symbol since it was not selected—although it could have been selected by either cur- sor. If we now move the second cursor to one time constant of 40 ms, we ﬁnd that the voltage is 12.633 V as shown in the Probe Cursor dia- log box. This conﬁrms the fact that the voltage should be 63.2% of its ﬁnal value of 20 V in one time constant (0.632 \u0006 20 V \u0001 12.4 V). Two separate plots could have been obtained by going to Plot-Add Plot to Window and then using the trace sequence again. Average Capacitive Current As an exercise in using the pulse source and to verify our analysis of the average current for a purely capacitive network, the description to follow will verify the results of Example 10.13. For the pulse waveform of Fig. 10.59, the parameters of the pulse supply appear in Fig. 10.79. Note that the rise time is now 2 ms, starting at 0 s, and the fall time is 6 ms. The period was set at 15 ms to permit monitoring the current after the pulse had passed. Simulation is initiated by ﬁrst selecting the New Simulation Proﬁle key to obtain the New Simulation dialog box in which AverageIC is entered as the Name. Create is then chosen to obtain the Simulation FIG. 10.79 Using PSpice to verify the results of Example 10.13. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  425 Settings-AverageIC dialog box. Analysis is selected, and Time Domain(Transient) is chosen under the Analysis type options. The Run to time is set to 15 ms to encompass the period of interest, and the Start saving data after is set at 0 s to ensure data points starting at t \u0001 0 s. The Maximum step size is selected from 15 ms/1000 \u0001 15 ms to ensure 1000 data points for the plot. Click OK, and the Run PSpice key is selected. A window will appear with a horizontal scale that extends from 0 to 15 ms as deﬁned above. Then the Add Trace key is selected, and I(C) is chosen to appear in the Trace Expression below. Click OK, and the plot of I(C) appears in the bottom of Fig. 10.80. This time it would be nice to see the pulse waveform in the same window but as a separate plot. Therefore, continue with Plot-Add Plot to Window- Trace-Add Trade-V(Vpulse:\u0004)-OK, and both plots appear as shown in Fig. 10.80. FIG. 10.80 The applied pulse and resulting current for the 2-mF capacitor of Fig. 10.79. The cursors can now be used to measure the resulting average cur- rent levels. First, select the I(C) plot to move the SEL>> notation to the lower plot. The SEL>> deﬁnes which plot for multiplot screens is active. Then select the Toggle cursor key, and left-click on the I(C) plot to establish the crosshairs of the cursor. Set the value at 1 ms, and the magnitude A1 is displayed as 4 mA. Right-click on the same plot, and a second cursor will result that can be placed at 6 ms to get a response of \u00021.33 mA (A2) as expected from Example 10.13. Both plots were again placed in the yellow color with a wider line by right- clicking on the curve and choosing Properties. 426  CAPACITORS PROBLEMS SECTION 10.2 The Electric Field 1.

Generators, motors, trans- formers, circuit breakers, televisions, computers, tape recorders, and telephones all employ magnetic effects to perform a variety of impor- tant tasks. The compass, used by Chinese sailors as early as the second century A.D., relies on a permanent magnet for indicating direction. The per- manent magnet is made of a material, such as steel or iron, that will remain magnetized for long periods of time without the need for an external source of energy. In 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted discovered that the needle of a compass would deﬂect if brought near a current- carrying conductor. For the ﬁrst time it was demonstrated that elec- tricity and magnetism were related, and in the same year the French physicist André-Marie Ampère performed experiments in this area and developed what is presently known as Ampère’s circuital law. In sub- sequent years, men such as Michael Faraday, Karl Friedrich Gauss, and James Clerk Maxwell continued to experiment in this area and developed many of the basic concepts of electromagnetism—mag- netic effects induced by the ﬂow of charge, or current. There is a great deal of similarity between the analyses of electric circuits and magnetic circuits. This will be demonstrated later in this chapter when we compare the basic equations and methods used to solve magnetic circuits with those used for electric circuits. Difﬁculty in understanding methods used with magnetic circuits will often arise in simply learning to use the proper set of units, not because of the equations themselves. The problem exists because three different systems of units are still used in the industry. To the extent practical, SI will be used throughout this chapter. For the CGS and English systems, a conversion table is provided in Appendix F. Magnetic Circuits 436  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS 11.2 MAGNETIC FIELDS In the region surrounding a permanent magnet there exists a magnetic ﬁeld, which can be represented by magnetic ﬂux lines similar to elec- tric ﬂux lines. Magnetic ﬂux lines, however, do not have origins or ter- minating points as do electric ﬂux lines but exist in continuous loops, as shown in Fig. 11.1. The symbol for magnetic ﬂux is the Greek letter \u0001 (phi). The magnetic ﬂux lines radiate from the north pole to the south pole, returning to the north pole through the metallic bar. Note the equal spacing between the ﬂux lines within the core and the symmetric distri- bution outside the magnetic material. These are additional properties of magnetic ﬂux lines in homogeneous materials (that is, materials having uniform structure or composition throughout). It is also important to realize that the continuous magnetic ﬂux line will strive to occupy as small an area as possible. This will result in magnetic ﬂux lines of min- imum length between the like poles, as shown in Fig. 11.2. The strength of a magnetic ﬁeld in a particular region is directly related to the den- sity of ﬂux lines in that region. In Fig. 11.1, for example, the magnetic ﬁeld strength at a is twice that at b since twice as many magnetic ﬂux lines are associated with the perpendicular plane at a than at b. Recall from childhood experiments that the strength of permanent magnets was always stronger near the poles. If unlike poles of two permanent magnets are brought together, the magnets will attract, and the ﬂux distribution will be as shown in Fig. 11.2. If like poles are brought together, the magnets will repel, and the ﬂux distribution will be as shown in Fig. 11.3.

FIG. 11.5 Effect of a magnetic shield on the ﬂux distribution. Sensitive instrument Soft iron If a nonmagnetic material, such as glass or copper, is placed in the ﬂux paths surrounding a permanent magnet, there will be an almost unnoticeable change in the ﬂux distribution (Fig. 11.4). However, if a magnetic material, such as soft iron, is placed in the ﬂux path, the ﬂux lines will pass through the soft iron rather than the surrounding air because ﬂux lines pass with greater ease through magnetic materials than through air. This principle is put to use in the shielding of sensitive electrical elements and instruments that can be affected by stray mag- netic ﬁelds (Fig. 11.5). As indicated in the introduction, a magnetic ﬁeld (represented by concentric magnetic ﬂux lines, as in Fig. 11.6) is present around every wire that carries an electric current. The direction of the magnetic ﬂux lines can be found simply by placing the thumb of the right hand in the direction of conventional current ﬂow and noting the direction of the MAGNETIC FIELDS  437 Conductor Magnetic flux lines I FIG. 11.6 Magnetic ﬂux lines around a current-carrying conductor.

If the conductor is wound in a single-turn coil (Fig. 11.7), the resulting ﬂux will ﬂow in a common direction through the center of the coil. A coil of more than one turn would produce a magnetic ﬁeld that would exist in a continuous path through and around the coil (Fig. 11.8). The ﬂux distribution of the coil is quite similar to that of the perma- nent magnet. The ﬂux lines leaving the coil from the left and entering to the right simulate a north and a south pole, respectively. The princi- pal difference between the two ﬂux distributions is that the ﬂux lines are more concentrated for the permanent magnet than for the coil. Also, since the strength of a magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the density of the ﬂux lines, the coil has a weaker ﬁeld strength. The ﬁeld strength of the coil can be effectively increased by placing certain materials, such as iron, steel, or cobalt, within the coil to increase the ﬂux density (deﬁned in the next section) within the coil. By increasing the ﬁeld strength with the addition of the core, we have devised an electromagnet (Fig. 11.9) that, in addition to having all the properties of a permanent magnet, also has a ﬁeld strength that can be varied by changing one of the compo- nent values (current, turns, and so on). Of course, current must pass through the coil of the electromagnet in order for magnetic ﬂux to be developed, whereas there is no need for the coil or current in the per- manent magnet. The direction of ﬂux lines can be determined for the electromagnet (or in any core with a wrapping of turns) by placing the ﬁngers of the right hand in the direction of current ﬂow around the core. The thumb will then point in the direction of the north pole of the induced magnetic ﬂux, as demonstrated in Fig. 11.10(a).

The number of ﬂux lines per unit area is called the ﬂux density, is denoted by the capital letter B, and is measured in teslas (note Fig. 11.15). Its magnitude is determined by the following equation: B \u0002 teslas (T) B \u0002\u0001 \u0002 webers (Wb) (11.1) A \u0002 square meters (m 2) where \u0001 is the number of ﬂux lines passing through the area A (Fig. 11.13). The ﬂux density at position a in Fig. 11.1 is twice that at b because twice as many ﬂux lines are passing through the same area.

This variation in strength is due to the greater or lesser number of ﬂux lines passing through the core. Materials in which ﬂux lines can readily be set up are said to be magnetic and to have high permeability. The permeability (m) of a material, therefore, is a measure of the ease with which mag- netic ﬂux lines can be established in the material. It is similar in many respects to conductivity in electric circuits. The permeability of free space mo (vacuum) is mo \u0002 4p \u0004 10 \u00057 As indicated above, m has the units of Wb/A· m. Practically speak- ing, the permeability of all nonmagnetic materials, such as copper, alu- minum, wood, glass, and air, is the same as that for free space. Materi- als that have permeabilities slightly less than that of free space are said to be diamagnetic, and those with permeabilities slightly greater than that of free space are said to be paramagnetic. Magnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, steel, cobalt, and alloys of these metals, have per- meabilities hundreds and even thousands of times that of free space. Materials with these very high permeabilities are referred to as ferro- magnetic.

Croatian-American (Smiljan, Paris, Colorado Springs, New York City) (1856–1943) Electrical Engineer and Inventor Recipient of the Edison Medal in 1917 Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 52,223 Often regarded as one of the most innovative and inventive individuals in the history of the sciences. He was the ﬁrst to introduce the alternating-current machine, removing the need for commutator bars of dc machines. After emigrating to the United States in 1884, he sold a number of his patents on ac machines, transformers, and induction coils (includ- ing the Tesla coil as we know it today) to the West- inghouse Electric Company. Some say that his most important discovery was made at his laboratory in Colorado Springs, where in 1900 he discovered ter- restrial stationary waves. The range of his discover- ies and inventions is too extensive to list here but extends from lighting systems to polyphase power systems to a wireless world broadcasting system. 440  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS The ratio of the permeability of a material to that of free space is called its relative permeability; that is, (11.2) In general, for ferromagnetic materials, mr ≥ 100, and for nonmagnetic materials, mr \u0002 1. Since mr is a variable, dependent on other quantities of the magnetic circuit, values of mr are not tabulated. Methods of calculating mr from the data supplied by manufacturers will be considered in a later section. 11.5 RELUCTANCE The resistance of a material to the ﬂow of charge (current) is deter- mined for electric circuits by the equation R \u0002 r\u0003 A l \u0003 (ohms, \u0006) The reluctance of a material to the setting up of magnetic ﬂux lines in the material is determined by the following equation: (rels, or At/Wb) (11.3) where \u0001 is the reluctance, l is the length of the magnetic path, and A is the cross-sectional area. The t in the units At/Wb is the number of turns of the applied winding. More is said about ampere-turns (At) in the next section. Note that the resistance and reluctance are inversely propor- tional to the area, indicating that an increase in area will result in a reduction in each and an increase in the desired result: current and ﬂux. For an increase in length the opposite is true, and the desired effect is reduced. The reluctance, however, is inversely proportional to the per- meability, while the resistance is directly proportional to the resistivity. The larger the m or the smaller the r, the smaller the reluctance and resistance, respectively. Obviously, therefore, materials with high per- meability, such as the ferromagnetics, have very small reluctances and will result in an increased measure of ﬂux through the core. There is no widely accepted unit for reluctance, although the rel and the At/Wb are usually applied. 11.6 OHM’S LAW FOR MAGNETIC CIRCUITS Recall the equation Effect \u0002 appearing in Chapter 4 to introduce Ohm’s law for electric circuits. For magnetic circuits, the effect desired is the ﬂux \u0001. The cause is the mag- netomotive force (mmf) \u0002, which is the external force (or “pressure”) required to set up the magnetic ﬂux lines within the magnetic material. The opposition to the setting up of the ﬂux \u0001 is the reluctance \u0001. cause\u0003\u0003 opposition \u0001 \u0002 \u0003 m l A \u0003 mr \u0002 \u0003 m m o \u0003 MAGNETIZING FORCE  441 Substituting, we have (11.4) The magnetomotive force \u0002 is proportional to the product of the number of turns around the core (in which the ﬂux is to be estab- lished) and the current through the turns of wire (Fig. 11.17). In equa- tion form, (ampere-turns, At) (11.5) This equation clearly indicates that an increase in the number of turns or the current through the wire will result in an increased “pressure” on the system to establish ﬂux lines through the core. Although there is a great deal of similarity between electric and magnetic circuits, one must continue to realize that the ﬂux \u0001 is not a “ﬂow” variable such as current in an electric circuit. Magnetic ﬂux is established in the core through the alteration of the atomic structure of the core due to external pressure and is not a measure of the ﬂow of some charged particles through the core. 11.7 MAGNETIZING FORCE The magnetomotive force per unit length is called the magnetizing force (H). In equation form, (At/m) (11.6) Substituting for the magnetomotive force will result in (At/m) (11.7) For the magnetic circuit of Fig. 11.18, if NI \u0002 40 At and l \u0002 0.2 m, then H \u0002 \u0003 N lI \u0003\u0002\u0002 200 At/m In words, the result indicates that there are 200 At of “pressure” per meter to establish ﬂux in the core. Note in Fig. 11.18 that the direction of the ﬂux \u0001 can be determined by placing the ﬁngers of the right hand in the direction of current around the core and noting the direction of the thumb. It is interesting to realize that the magnetizing force is independent of the type of core material—it is determined solely by the number of turns, the current, and the length of the core. The applied magnetizing force has a pronounced effect on the result- ing permeability of a magnetic material. As the magnetizing force increases, the permeability rises to a maximum and then drops to a min- imum, as shown in Fig. 11.19 for three commonly employed magnetic materials. 40 At\u0003 0.2 m H \u0002 \u0003 N lI \u0003 H \u0002 \u0003 \u0002 l \u0003 \u0002 \u0002 NI \u0001\u0002 \u0003 \u0001 \u0002 \u0003 I I \u0001 N turns FIG. 11.17 Deﬁning the components of a magnetomotive force.

Since henries (H) and the magnetizing force (H) use the same capi- tal letter, it must be pointed out that all units of measurement in the text, such as henries, use roman letters, such as H, whereas variables such as the magnetizing force use italic letters, such as H. 11.8 HYSTERESIS A curve of the ﬂux density B versus the magnetizing force H of a mate- rial is of particular importance to the engineer. Curves of this type can usually be found in manuals, descriptive pamphlets, and brochures pub- lished by manufacturers of magnetic materials. A typical B-H curve for a ferromagnetic material such as steel can be derived using the setup of Fig. 11.20. The core is initially unmagnetized and the current I \u0002 0. If the cur- rent I is increased to some value above zero, the magnetizing force H will increase to a value determined by H \u0002 \u0003 N l ID \u0003 The ﬂux \u0001 and the ﬂux density B (B \u0002\u0001/A) will also increase with the current I (or H). If the material has no residual magnetism, and the magnetizing force H is increased from zero to some value Ha, the B-H curve will follow the path shown in Fig. 11.21 between o and a. If the B \u0002 mH FIG. 11.19 Variation of m with the magnetizing force.

When saturation occurs, the ﬂux density has, for all practical purposes, reached its maximum value. Any further increase in current through the coil increasing H \u0002 NI/l will result in a very small increase in ﬂux density B. If the magnetizing force is reduced to zero by letting I decrease to zero, the curve will follow the path of the curve between b and c. The ﬂux density BR, which remains when the magnetizing force is zero, is called the residual ﬂux density. It is this residual ﬂux density that makes it possible to create permanent magnets. If the coil is now removed from the core of Fig. 11.20, the core will still have the magnetic prop- erties determined by the residual ﬂux density, a measure of its “reten- tivity.” If the current I is reversed, developing a magnetizing force, \u0005H, the ﬂux density B will decrease with an increase in I. Eventually, the ﬂux density will be zero when \u0005Hd (the portion of curve from c to d) is reached. The magnetizing force \u0005Hd required to “coerce” the ﬂux density to reduce its level to zero is called the coercive force, a measure of the coercivity of the magnetic sample. As the force \u0005H is increased until saturation again occurs and is then reversed and brought back to zero, the path def will result. If the magnetizing force is increased in the positive direction (\u0007H), the curve will trace the path shown from f to b. The entire curve represented by bcdefb is called the hysteresis curve for the ferromagnetic material, from the Greek hysterein, meaning “to lag behind.” The ﬂux density B lagged behind the magnetizing force H dur- ing the entire plotting of the curve. When H was zero at c, B was not zero but had only begun to decline. Long after H had passed through zero and had become equal to \u0005Hd did the ﬂux density B ﬁnally become equal to zero. If the entire cycle is repeated, the curve obtained for the same core will be determined by the maximum H applied. Three hysteresis loops for the same material for maximum values of H less than the saturation value are shown in Fig. 11.22. In addition, the saturation curve is repeated for comparison purposes. Note from the various curves that for a particular value of H, say, Hx, the value of B can vary widely, as determined by the history of the core. In an effort to assign a particular value of B to each value of H, we compromise by connecting the tips of the hysteresis loops.

An expanded view of one region appears in Fig. 11.24. A comparison of Figs. 11.19 and 11.23 shows that for the same value of H, the value of B is higher in Fig. 11.23 for the materials with the higher m in Fig. 11.19. This is particularly obvious for low values of H. This correspondence between the two ﬁgures must exist since B \u0002 mH. In fact, if in Fig. 11.23 we ﬁnd m for each value of H using the equa- tion m \u0002 B/H, we will obtain the curves of Fig. 11.19. An instrument that will provide a plot of the B-H curve for a magnetic sample appears in Fig. 11.25. It is interesting to note that the hysteresis curves of Fig. 11.22 have a point symmetry about the origin; that is, the inverted pattern to the left of the vertical axis is the same as that appearing to the right of the ver- HS H (At/m) H3 Hx B (T ) H1 H2 FIG. 11.22 Deﬁning the normal magnetization curve. 0 Sheet steel Cast steel Cast iron 300 600 900 1200 1500 1800 2100 2400 2700 3000 3300 3600 3900 4200 4500 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 B (T) H(At/m) FIG. 11.23 Normal magnetization curve for three ferromagnetic materials.

In addition, you will ﬁnd that a further application of the same magnetizing forces to the sample will result in the same plot. For a current I in H \u0002 NI/l that will move between positive and negative maximums at a ﬁxed rate, the same B-H curve will result during each cycle. Such will be the case when we examine ac (sinusoidal) networks in the later chapters. The reversal of the ﬁeld (\u0001) due to the changing current direction will result in a loss of energy that can best be described by ﬁrst introducing the domain theory of magnetism. Within each atom, the orbiting electrons (described in Chapter 2) are also spinning as they revolve around the nucleus. The atom, due to its spinning electrons, has a magnetic ﬁeld associated with it. In nonmag- netic materials, the net magnetic ﬁeld is effectively zero since the mag- netic ﬁelds due to the atoms of the material oppose each other. In mag- netic materials such as iron and steel, however, the magnetic ﬁelds of groups of atoms numbering in the order of 1012 are aligned, forming very small bar magnets. This group of magnetically aligned atoms is called a domain. Each domain is a separate entity; that is, each domain is independent of the surrounding domains. For an unmagnetized sam- ple of magnetic material, these domains appear in a random manner, such as shown in Fig. 11.26(a). The net magnetic ﬁeld in any one direc- tion is zero. FIG. 11.25 Model 9600 vibrating sample magnetometer. (Courtesy of LDJ Electronics, Inc.) (a) (b) SN FIG. 11.26 Demonstrating the domain theory of magnetism. When an external magnetizing force is applied, the domains that are nearly aligned with the applied ﬁeld will grow at the expense of the less favorably oriented domains, such as shown in Fig. 11.26(b). Eventually, if a sufﬁciently strong ﬁeld is applied, all of the domains will have the orientation of the applied magnetizing force, and any further increase in external ﬁeld will not increase the strength of the magnetic ﬂux through the core—a condition referred to as saturation. The elasticity of the AMPÈRE’S CIRCUITAL LAW  447 above is evidenced by the fact that when the magnetizing force is removed, the alignment will be lost to some measure, and the ﬂux den- sity will drop to BR. In other words, the removal of the magnetizing force will result in the return of a number of misaligned domains within the core. The continued alignment of a number of the domains, how- ever, accounts for our ability to create permanent magnets. At a point just before saturation, the opposing unaligned domains are reduced to small cylinders of various shapes referred to as bubbles. These bubbles can be moved within the magnetic sample through the application of a controlling magnetic ﬁeld. These magnetic bubbles form the basis of the recently designed bubble memory system for com- puters. 11.9 AMPÈRE’S CIRCUITAL LAW As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, there is a broad sim- ilarity between the analyses of electric and magnetic circuits. This has already been demonstrated to some extent for the quantities in Table 11.1. If we apply the “cause” analogy to Kirchhoff’s voltage law ( V \u0002 0), we obtain the following: \u0002 \u0002 0 (for magnetic circuits) (11.9) which, in words, states that the algebraic sum of the rises and drops of the mmf around a closed loop of a magnetic circuit is equal to zero; that is, the sum of the rises in mmf equals the sum of the drops in mmf around a closed loop. Equation (11.9) is referred to as Ampère’s circuital law. When it is applied to magnetic circuits, sources of mmf are expressed by the equation (At) (11.10) The equation for the mmf drop across a portion of a magnetic circuit can be found by applying the relationships listed in Table 11.1; that is, for electric circuits, V \u0002 IR resulting in the following for magnetic circuits: (At) (11.11) where \u0001 is the ﬂux passing through a section of the magnetic circuit and \u0001 is the reluctance of that section. The reluctance, however, is sel- \u0002 \u0002\u0001\u0001 \u0002 \u0002 NI \b \b TABLE 11.1 Electric Circuits Magnetic Circuits Cause E \u0002 Effect I \u0001 Opposition R \u0001 448  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS dom calculated in the analysis of magnetic circuits. A more practical equation for the mmf drop is (At) (11.12) as derived from Eq. (11.6), where H is the magnetizing force on a sec- tion of a magnetic circuit and l is the length of the section. As an example of Eq. (11.9), consider the magnetic circuit appearing in Fig. 11.27 constructed of three different ferromagnetic materials. Applying Ampère’s circuital law, we have All the terms of the equation are known except the magnetizing force for each portion of the magnetic circuit, which can be found by using the B-H curve if the ﬂux density B is known. 11.10 THE FLUX \u0003 If we continue to apply the relationships described in the previous sec- tion to Kirchhoff’s current law, we will ﬁnd that the sum of the ﬂuxes entering a junction is equal to the sum of the ﬂuxes leaving a junction; that is, for the circuit of Fig. 11.28, \u0001a \u0002\u0001b \u0007\u0001c (at junction a) or \u0001b \u0007\u0001c \u0002\u0001a (at junction b) both of which are equivalent. 11.11 SERIES MAGNETIC CIRCUITS: DETERMINING NI We are now in a position to solve a few magnetic circuit problems, which are basically of two types. In one type, \u0001 is given, and the impressed mmf NI must be computed. This is the type of problem encountered in the design of motors, generators, and transformers. In the other type, NI is given, and the ﬂux \u0001 of the magnetic circuit must be found. This type of problem is encountered primarily in the design of magnetic ampliﬁers and is more difﬁcult since the approach is “hit or miss.” As indicated in earlier discussions, the value of m will vary from point to point along the magnetization curve. This eliminates the possi- bility of ﬁnding the reluctance of each “branch” or the “total reluc- tance” of a network, as was done for electric circuits where r had a ﬁxed value for any applied current or voltage. If the total reluctance could be determined, \u0001 could then be determined using the Ohm’s law analogy for magnetic circuits. For magnetic circuits, the level of B or H is determined from the other using the B-H curve, and m is seldom calculated unless asked for. \b \u0002 \u0002 0 \u0007NI \u0005 Hablab \u0005 Hbclbc \u0005 Hcalca \u0002 0 NI \u0002 Hablab \u0007 Hbclbc \u0007 Hcalca Drop mmf dropsImpressed mmf Rise Drop Drop \u0002 \u0002 Hl Iron \u0001 a c b Steel CobaltI I N turns FIG. 11.27 Series magnetic circuit of three different materials. \u0001a a I I N b \u0001c \u0001a \u0001c \u0001b FIG. 11.28 Flux distribution of a series-parallel magnetic network. SERIES MAGNETIC CIRCUITS: DETERMINING NI  449 An approach frequently employed in the analysis of magnetic cir- cuits is the table method. Before a problem is analyzed in detail, a table is prepared listing in the extreme left-hand column the various sections of the magnetic circuit. The columns on the right are reserved for the quantities to be found for each section. In this way, the individual doing the problem can keep track of what is required to complete the problem and also of what the next step should be. After a few examples, the use- fulness of this method should become clear. This section will consider only series magnetic circuits in which the ﬂux \u0001 is the same throughout. In each example, the magnitude of the magnetomotive force is to be determined. EXAMPLE 11.3 For the series magnetic circuit of Fig. 11.29: a. Find the value of I required to develop a magnetic ﬂux of \u0001\u0002 4 \u0004 10\u00054 Wb. b. Determine m and mr for the material under these conditions. Solutions: The magnetic circuit can be represented by the system shown in Fig. 11.30(a). The electric circuit analogy is shown in Fig. 11.30(b). Analogies of this type can be very helpful in the solution of magnetic circuits. Table 11.2 is for part (a) of this problem. The table is fairly trivial for this example, but it does deﬁne the quantities to be found.

This would result in 4 A versus 3.89 A above. This difference is normally ignored, however, and the equation N1I1 \u0002 N2I2 considered exact. Because of the nonlinearity of the B-H curve, it is not possible to apply superposition to magnetic circuits; that is, in Example 11.5, we cannot consider the effects of each source independently and then ﬁnd the total effects by using superposition. 11.12 AIR GAPS Before continuing with the illustrative examples, let us consider the effects that an air gap has on a magnetic circuit. Note the presence of air gaps in the magnetic circuits of the motor and meter of Fig. 11.11. The spreading of the ﬂux lines outside the common area of the core for the air gap in Fig. 11.35(a) is known as fringing. For our purposes, we shall neglect this effect and assume the ﬂux distribution to be as in Fig. 11.35(b). 116.8 At\u0003 30 t 1 \u0003 5 1.5 \u0004 10 \u00055 Wb\u0003\u0003 0.15 \u0004 10 \u00053 m 2 Section \u0003 (Wb) A (m 2) B (T) H (At/m) l (m) Hl (At) abcda 1.5 \u0004 10 \u00055 0.15 \u0004 10 \u00053 0.16 TABLE 11.5 \u0001abcda \u0001 \u00021 \u00022 Rabcda I E1 E2 (b)(a) FIG. 11.34 (a) Magnetic circuit equivalent and (b) electric circuit analogy for the transformer of Fig. 11.33. \u0001c \u0001c (a) \u0001c \u0001c (b) \u0001c Air gap FIG. 11.35 Air gaps: (a) with fringing; (b) ideal.

In fact, the electric circuit analogy will prove helpful in deﬁning the procedure to follow toward a solution.

This is a relatively straightforward prob- lem if only one magnetic section is involved. Then H \u0002 \u0003 N lI \u0003 H → B (B-H curve) and \u0001\u0002 BA Formagnetic circuits with more than one section, there is no set order of steps that will lead to an exact solution for every problem on the ﬁrst attempt. In general, however, we proceed as follows. We must ﬁnd the impressed mmf for a calculated guess of the ﬂux \u0001 and then compare this with the speciﬁed value of mmf. We can then make adjustments to our guess to bring it closer to the actual value. For most applications, a value within \t5% of the actual \u0001 or speciﬁed NI is acceptable. We can make a reasonable guess at the value of \u0001 if we realize that the maximum mmf drop appears across the material with the smallest per- meability if the length and area of each material are the same. As shown in Example 11.6, if there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit, there will be a considerable drop in mmf across the gap. As a starting point for problems of this type, therefore, we shall assume that the total mmf (NI) is across the section with the lowest m or greatest \u0001 (if the other physi- cal dimensions are relatively similar). This assumption gives a value of \u0001 that will produce a calculated NI greater than the speciﬁed value. Then, after considering the results of our original assumption very carefully, we shall cut \u0001 and NI by introducing the effects (reluctance) of the other por- tions of the magnetic circuit and try the new solution. For obvious reasons, this approach is frequently called the cut and try method. EXAMPLE 11.8 Calculate the magnetic ﬂux \u0001 for the magnetic cir- cuit of Fig. 11.40.

For instance, the VHS tape and the 8-mm cassette of Fig. 11.42 are used almost daily by every family with a VCR or cassette player. The basic recording process is not that difﬁcult to understand and will be described in detail in the section to follow on computer hard disks. 1.057 \u0004 10 \u00053 Wb\u0003\u0003 0.003 m 2 \u0001 \u0003 A \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0000\u0003\u0002 FIG. 11.42 Magnetic tape: (a) VHS and 8-mm cassette (Courtesy of Maxell Corporation of America); (b) manufacturing process (Courtesy of Ampex Corporation). APPLICATIONS  459 Speakers and Microphones Electromagnetic effects are the moving force in the design of speakers such as the one shown in Fig. 11.43. The shape of the pulsating waveform of the input current is determined by the sound to be reproduced by the speaker at a high audio level. As the current peaks and returns to the val- leys of the sound pattern, the strength of the electromagnet varies in exactly the same manner. This causes the cone of the speaker to vibrate at a frequency directly proportional to the pulsating input. The higher the pitch of the sound pattern, the higher the oscillating frequency between the peaks and valleys and the higher the frequency of vibration of the cone. A second design used more frequently in more expensive speaker systems appears in Fig. 11.44. In this case the permanent magnet is ﬁxed and the input is applied to a movable core within the magnet, as shown in the ﬁgure. High peaking currents at the input produce a strong ﬂux pattern in the voice coil, causing it to be drawn well into the ﬂux pattern of the permanent magnet. As occurred for the speaker of Fig. 11.43, the core then vibrates at a rate determined by the input and pro- vides the audible sound.

(Courtesy of Electro-Voice, Inc.) Microphones such as those in Fig. 11.45 also employ electromag- netic effects. The sound to be reproduced at a higher audio level causes the core and attached moving coil to move within the magnetic ﬁeld of the permanent magnet. Through Faraday’s law (e \u0002 N df/dt), a voltage is induced across the movable coil proportional to the speed with which it is moving through the magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting induced voltage pattern can then be ampliﬁed and reproduced at a much higher audio level through the use of speakers, as described earlier. Microphones of this type are the most frequently employed, although other types that use capacitive, carbon granular, and piezoelectric* effects are available. This particular design is commercially referred to as a dynamic micro- phone. *Piezoelectricity is the generation of a small voltage by exerting pressure across certain crystals. 460  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS Computer Hard Disks The computer hard disk is a sealed unit in a computer that stores data on a magnetic coating applied to the surface of circular platters that spin like a record. The platters are constructed on a base of aluminum or glass (both nonferromagnetic), which makes them rigid—hence the term hard disk. Since the unit is sealed, the internal platters and com- ponents are inaccessible, and a “crash” (a term applied to the loss of data from a disk or the malfunction thereof) usually requires that the entire unit be replaced. Hard disks are currently available with diame- ters from less than 1 in. to 5 1⁄4 in., with the 31⁄2 in. the most popular for today’s desktop units. Lap-top units typically use 21⁄2 in. All hard disk drives are often referred to as Winchester drives, a term ﬁrst applied in the 1960s to an IBM drive that had 30 MB [a byte is a series of binary bits (0s and 1s) representing a number, letter, or symbol] of ﬁxed (nonaccessible) data storage and 30 MB of accessible data storage. The term Winchester was applied because the 30-30 data capacity matched the name of the popular 30-30 Winchester riﬂe. The magnetic coating on the platters is called the media and is of either the oxide or the thin-ﬁlm variety. The oxide coating is formed by ﬁrst coating the platter with a gel containing iron-oxide (ferromagnetic) particles. The disk is then spun at a very high speed to spread the mate- rial evenly across the surface of the platter. The resulting surface is then covered with a protective coating that is made as smooth as possible. The thin-ﬁlm coating is very thin, but durable, with a surface that is smooth and consistent throughout the disk area. In recent years the trend has been toward the thin-ﬁlm coating because the read/write heads (to be described shortly) must travel closer to the surface of the platter, requiring a consistent coating thickness. Recent techniques have resulted in thin-ﬁlm magnetic coatings as thin as one-millionth of an inch. The information on a disk is stored around the disk in circular paths called tracks or cylinders, with each track containing so many bits of information per inch. The product of the number of bits per inch and the number of tracks per inch is the Areal density of the disk, which pro- vides an excellent quantity for comparison with early systems and reveals how far the ﬁeld has progressed in recent years. In the 1950s the ﬁrst drives had an Areal density of about 2 kbits/in.2 compared to today’s typical 4 Gbits/in.2, an incredible achievement; consider FIG. 11.45 Dynamic microphone. (Courtesy of Electro-Voice, Inc.) APPLICATIONS  461 4,000,000,000,000 bits of information on an area the size of the face of your watch. Electromagnetism is the key element in the writing of information on the disk and the reading of information off the disk. In its simplest form the write/read head of a hard disk (or ﬂoppy disk) is a U-shaped electromagnet with an air gap that rides just above the surface of the disk, as shown in Fig. 11.46. As the disk rotates, information in the form of a voltage with changing polarities is applied to the winding of the electromagnet. For our purposes we will associate a positive voltage level with a 1 level (of binary arithmetic) and a neg- ative voltage level with a 0 level. Combinations of these 0 and 1 levels can be used to represent letters, numbers, or symbols. If energized as shown in Fig. 11.46 with a 1 level (positive voltage), the resulting mag- netic ﬂux pattern will have the direction shown in the core. When the ﬂux pattern encounters the air gap of the core, it jumps to the magnetic material (since magnetic ﬂux always seeks the path of least reluctance and air has a high reluctance) and establishes a ﬂux pattern, as shown on the disk, until it reaches the other end of the core air gap, where it returns to the electromagnet and completes the path. As the head then moves to the next bit sector, it leaves behind the magnetic ﬂux pattern just established from the left to the right. The next bit sector has a 0 level input (negative voltage) that reverses the polarity of the applied voltage and the direction of the magnetic ﬂux in the core of the head. The result is a ﬂux pattern in the disk opposite that associated with a 1 level. The next bit of information is also a 0 level, resulting in the same pattern just generated. In total, therefore, information is stored on the disk in the form of small magnets whose polarity deﬁnes whether they are representing a 0 or a 1.

Now that the data have been stored, we must have some method to retrieve the information when desired. The ﬁrst few hard disks used the same head for both the write and the read functions. In Fig. 11.47(a), the U-shaped electromagnet in the read mode simply picks up the ﬂux pattern of the current bit of information. Faraday’s law of electromag- net induction states that a voltage is induced across a coil if exposed to a changing magnetic ﬁeld. The change in ﬂux for the core in Fig. 11.47(a) is minimal as it passes over the induced bar magnet on the sur- face of the disk. A ﬂux pattern is established in the core because of the 462  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS ∆Φ ≅ 0 Wb V ≅ 0 V N + – SNS NS c 100 a b 0 V 0 1 V a 0 V 0 V b t 01 c (a) (b) FIG. 11.47 Reading the information off a hard disk using a U-shaped electromagnet. bar magnet on the disk, but the lack of a signiﬁcant change in ﬂux level results in an induced voltage at the output terminals of the pickup of approximately 0 V, as shown in Fig. 11.47(b) for the readout waveform. A signiﬁcant change in ﬂux occurs when the head passes over the tran- sition region so marked in Fig. 11.47(a). In region a the ﬂux pattern changes from one direction to the other—a signiﬁcant change in ﬂux occurs in the core as it reverses direction, causing a measurable voltage to be generated across the terminals of the pickup coil as dictated by Faraday’s law and indicated in Fig. 11.47(b). In region b there is no sig- niﬁcant change in the ﬂux pattern from one bit area to the next, and a voltage is not generated, as also revealed in Fig. 11.47(b). However, when region c is reached, the change in ﬂux is signiﬁcant but opposite that occurring in region a, resulting in another pulse but of opposite polarity. In total, therefore, the output bits of information are in the form of pulses that have a shape totally different from the read signals but that are certainly representative of the information being stored. In addition, note that the output is generated at the transition regions and not in the constant ﬂux region of the bit storage. In the early years, the use of the same head for the read and write functions was acceptable; but as the tracks became narrower and the seek time (the average time required to move from one track to another a ran- dom distance away) had to be reduced, it became increasingly difﬁcult to construct the coil or core conﬁguration in a manner that was sufﬁciently thin with minimum weight. In the late 1970s IBM introduced the thin- ﬁlm inductive head, which was manufactured in much the same way as the small integrated circuits of today. The result is a head having a length typically less than 1⁄10 in., a height less than 1⁄50 in., and minimum mass and high durability. The average seek time has dropped from a few hun- dred milliseconds to 6 ms to 8 ms for very fast units and 8 ms to 10 ms for average units. In addition, production methods have improved to the point that the head can “ﬂoat” above the surface (to minimize damage to the disk) at a height of only 5 microinches or 0.000005 in. Using a typi- cal lap-top hard disk speed of 3600 rpm (as high as 7200 rpm for desk- tops) and an average diameter of 1.75 in. for a 3.5-in. disk, the speed of the head over the track is about 38 mph. Scaling the ﬂoating height up to 1⁄4 in. (multiplying by a factor of 50,000), the speed would increase to about 1.9 \u0004 106 mph. In other words, the speed of the head over the sur- face of the platter is analogous to a mass traveling 1⁄4 in. above a surface at 1.9 million miles per hour, all the while ensuring that the head never touches the surface of the disk—quite a technical achievement and amaz- APPLICATIONS  463 ingly enough one that perhaps will be improved by a factor of 10 in the next decade. Incidentally, the speed of rotation of ﬂoppy disks is about 1⁄10 that of the hard disk, or 360 rpm. In addition, the head touches the magnetic surface of the ﬂoppy disk, limiting the storage life of the unit. The typical magnetizing force needed to lay down the magnetic orienta- tion is 400 mA-turn (peak-to-peak). The result is a write current of only 40 mA for a 10-turn, thin-ﬁlm inductive head. Although the thin-ﬁlm inductive head could also be used as a read head, the magnetoresistive (MR) head has improved reading character- istics. The MR head depends on the fact that the resistance of a soft fer- romagnetic conductor such as permolloy is sensitive to changes in external magnetic ﬁelds. As the hard disk rotates, the changes in mag- netic ﬂux from the induced magnetized regions of the platter change the terminal resistance of the head. A constant current passed through the sensor displays a terminal voltage sensitive to the magnitude of the resistance. The result is output voltages with peak values in excess of 300 V, which exceeds that of typical inductive read heads by a factor of 2 or 3\u00011. Further investigation will reveal that the best write head is of the thin-ﬁlm inductive variety and that the optimum read head is of the MR variety. Each has particular design criteria for maximum performance, resulting in the increasingly common dual-element head, with each head containing separate conductive paths and different gap widths. The Areal density of the new hard disks will essentially require the dual-head assembly for optimum performance. As the density of the disk increases, the width of the tracks or cylinders will decrease accordingly. The net result will be smaller heads for the read/write function, an arm supporting the head that must be able to move into and out of the rotating disk in smaller increments, and an increased sensitivity to temperature effects which can cause the disk itself to contract or expand. At one time the mechanical system with its gears and pulleys was sensitive enough to perform the task. However, today’s density requires a system with less play and with less sensitivity to outside factors such as temperature and vibration. A number of modern drives use a voice coil and ferro- magnetic arm as shown in Fig. 11.48. The current through the coil will determine the magnetic ﬁeld strength within the coil and will cause Voice coil Read/Write head Ferromagnetic shaft Control FIG. 11.48 Disk drive with voice coil and ferromagnetic arm. 464  MAGNETIC CIRCUITS the supporting arm for the head to move in and out, thereby estab- lishing a rough setting for the extension of the arm over the disk. It would certainly be possible to relate the position of the arm to the applied voltage to the coil, but this would lack the level of accuracy required for high-density disks. For the desired accuracy, a laser beam has been added as an integral part of the head. Circular strips placed around the disk (called track indicators) ensure that the laser beam homes in and keeps the head in the right position. Assuming that the track is a smooth surface and the surrounding area a rough texture, a laser beam will be reﬂected back to the head if it’s on the track, whereas the beam will be scattered if it hits the adjoining areas. This type of system permits continuous recalibration of the arm by simply comparing its position with the desired location—a maneuver referred to as “recalibration on the ﬂy.” As with everything, there are limits to any design. However, in this case, it is not because larger disks cannot be made or that more tracks cannot be put on the disk. The limit to the size of hard drives in PCs is set by the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) drive that is built into all PCs. When ﬁrst developed years ago, it was designed around a maximum storage possibility of 8.4 gigabytes. At that time this num- ber seemed sufﬁciently large to withstand any new developments for many years to come. However, 8-gigabyte drives and larger are now becoming commonplace, with lap-tops averaging 20 gigabytes and desktops averaging 40 gigabytes. The result is that mathematical meth- ods had to be developed to circumvent the designed maximum for each component of the BIOS system. Fundamentally, the maximum values for the BIOS drive are the following: Cylinders (or tracks) 1024 Heads 128 Sectors 128 Bytes per sector 512 Multiplying through all the factors results in a maximum of 8.59 giga- bytes, but the colloquial reference is normally 8.4 gigabytes. Most modern drives use a BIOS translation technique whereby they play a mathematical game in which they make the drive appear different to the BIOS system than it actually is. For instance, the drive may have 2048 tracks and 16 heads, but through the mathematical link with the BIOS system it will appear to have 1024 tracks and 32 heads. In other words, there was a trade-off between numbers in the ofﬁcial maximum listing. This is okay for certain combinations, but the total combination of ﬁgures for the design still cannot exceed 8.4 gigabytes. Also be aware that this mathematical manipulation is possible only if the operating sys- tem has BIOS translation built in. By implementing new enchanced IDE controllers, BIOS can have access drives greater than 8.4 gigabytes. The above is clear evidence of the importance of magnetic effects in today’s growing industrial, computer-oriented society. Although research continues to maximize the Areal density, it appears certain that the storage will remain magnetic for the write/read process and will not be replaced by any of the growing alternatives such as the optic laser variety used so commonly in CD-ROMs. A 3.5-in. full-height disk drive, which is manufactured by the Seagate Corporation and has a formatted capacity of 17.2 gigabytes (GB) with an average search time of 9 ms, appears in Fig. 11.49.

Hall Effect Sensor The Hall effect sensor is a semiconductor device that generates an out- put voltage when exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld. The basic construction consists of a slab of semiconductor material through which a current is passed, as shown in Fig. 11.50(a). If a magnetic ﬁeld is applied as shown in the ﬁgure perpendicular to the direction of the current, a voltage VH will be generated between the two terminals, as indicated in Fig. 11.50(a). The difference in potential is due to the separation of charge established by the Lorentz force ﬁrst studied by Professor Hen- drick Lorentz in the early eighteenth century. He found that electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld are subjected to a force proportional to the veloc- ity of the electrons through the ﬁeld and the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. The direction of the force is determined by the left-hand rule. Simply place the index ﬁnger of the left hand in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, with the second ﬁnger at right angles to the index ﬁn- ger in the direction of conventional current through the semiconductor material, as shown in Fig. 11.50(b). The thumb, if placed at right angles to the index ﬁnger, will indicate the direction of the force on the electrons. In Fig. 11.50(b), the force causes the electrons to accu- mulate in the bottom region of the semiconductor (connected to the negative terminal of the voltage VH), leaving a net positive charge in the upper region of the material (connected to the positive terminal of VH). The stronger the current or strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, the greater the induced voltage VH. In essence, therefore, the Hall effect sensor can reveal the strength of a magnetic ﬁeld or the level of current through a device if the other determining factor is held ﬁxed. Two applications of the sensor are therefore apparent—to measure the strength of a magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of a sensor (for an applied ﬁxed current) and to measure the level of current through a sensor (with knowledge of the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld linking the sensor). The gaussmeter in Fig. 11.16 employs a Hall effect sensor. Internal to the meter, a ﬁxed current is passed through the sensor with the voltage VH indicating the relative strength of the ﬁeld. Through ampliﬁcation, calibration, and proper scaling, the meter can display the relative strength in gauss. The Hall effect sensor has a broad range of applications that are often quite interesting and innovative. The most widespread is as a trigger for an alarm system in large department stores, where theft is often a difﬁ- cult problem. A magnetic strip attached to the merchandise sounds an alarm when a customer passes through the exit gates without paying for the product. The sensor, control current, and monitoring system are housed in the exit fence and react to the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld as the product leaves the store. When the product is paid for, the cashier removes the strip or demagnetizes the strip by applying a magnetizing force that reduces the residual magnetism in the strip to essentially zero. The Hall effect sensor is also used to indicate the speed of a bicycle on a digital display conveniently mounted on the handlebars. As shown in Fig. 11.51(a), the sensor is mounted on the frame of the bike, and a small permanent magnet is mounted on a spoke of the front wheel. The magnet must be carefully mounted to be sure that it passes over the proper region of the sensor. When the magnet passes over the sensor, the ﬂux pattern in Fig. 11.51(b) results, and a voltage with a sharp peak is developed by the sensor.

It is interesting to note that at a speed of 20 mph, the wheel is rotating at more than 4 revolutions per second, and the total number of rotations over 20 mi is 15,460. Magnetic Reed Switch One of the most frequently employed switches in alarm systems is the magnetic reed switch shown in Fig. 11.52. As shown by the ﬁgure, there are two components of the reed switch—a permanent magnet embedded in one unit that is normally connected to the movable element (door, win- dow, and so on) and a reed switch in the other unit that is connected to the electrical control circuit. The reed switch is constructed of two iron- alloy (ferromagnetic) reeds in a hermetically sealed capsule. The can- tilevered ends of the two reeds do not touch but are in very close prox- imity to one another. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld the reeds remain separated. However, if a magnetic ﬁeld is introduced, the reeds will be drawn to each other because ﬂux lines seek the path of least reluctance and, if possible, exercise every alternative to establish the path of least reluctance. It is similar to placing a ferromagnetic bar close to the ends of a U-shaped magnet. The bar is drawn to the poles of the magnet, estab- lishing a magnetic ﬂux path without air gaps and with minimum reluc- tance. In the open-circuit state the resistance between reeds is in excess of 100 M\u0006, while in the on state it drops to less than 1 \u0006. In Fig. 11.53 a reed switch has been placed on the ﬁxed frame of a window and a magnet on the movable window unit.

APPLICATIONS  467 ciently close to establish contact between the reeds, and a current is established through the reed switch to the control panel. In the armed state the alarm system accepts the resulting current ﬂow as a normal secure response. If the window is opened, the magnet will leave the vicinity of the reed switch, and the switch will open. The current through the switch will be interrupted, and the alarm will react appro- priately. One of the distinct advantages of the magnetic reed switch is that the proper operation of any switch can be checked with a portable magnetic element. Simply bring the magnet to the switch and note the output response. There is no need to continually open and close windows and doors. In addition, the reed switch is hermetically enclosed so that oxi- dation and foreign objects cannot damage it, and the result is a unit that can last indeﬁnitely. Magnetic reed switches are also available in other shapes and sizes, allowing them to be concealed from obvious view. One is a circular variety that can be set into the edge of a door and door jam, resulting in only two small visible disks when the door is open. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, also called nuclear magnetic reso- nance (NMR)] is receiving more and more attention as we strive to improve the quality of the cross-sectional images of the body so useful in medical diagnosis and treatment. MRI does not expose the patient to potentially hazardous X rays or injected contrast materials such as those employed to obtain computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans. The three major components of an MRI system are a huge magnet that can weigh up to 100 tons, a table for transporting the patient into the circular hole in the magnet, and a control center, as shown in Fig. 11.54. The image is obtained by placing the patient in the tube to a pre- cise depth depending on the cross section to be obtained and applying a strong magnetic ﬁeld that causes the nuclei of certain atoms in the body to line up. Radio waves of different frequencies are then applied to the patient in the region of interest, and if the frequency of the wave matches the natural frequency of the atom, the nuclei will be set into a state of resonance and will absorb energy from the applied signal. When the signal is removed, the nuclei release the acquired energy in the form of weak but detectable signals. The strength and duration of the energy emission vary from one tissue of the body to another. The weak signals are then ampliﬁed, digitized, and translated to provide a cross-sectional image such as the one shown in Fig. 11.55. MRI units are very expensive and therefore are not available at all locations. In recent years, however, their numbers have grown, and one is available in almost every major community. For some patients the claustrophobic feeling they experience while in the circular tube is dif- ﬁcult to contend with. Today, however, a more open unit has been developed, as shown in Fig. 11.56, that has removed most of this dis- comfort. Patients who have metallic implants or pacemakers or those who have worked in industrial environments where minute ferromagnetic particles may have become lodged in open, sensitive areas such as the eyes, nose, and so on, may have to use a CAT scan system because it does not employ magnetic effects.

In this chap- ter we shall consider a third element, the inductor, which has a number of response characteristics similar in many respects to those of the capacitor. In fact, some sections of this chapter will proceed parallel to those for the capacitor to emphasize the similarity that exists between the two elements. 12.2 FARADAY’S LAW OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION If a conductor is moved through a magnetic ﬁeld so that it cuts mag- netic lines of ﬂux, a voltage will be induced across the conductor, as shown in Fig. 12.1. The greater the number of ﬂux lines cut per unit time (by increasing the speed with which the conductor passes through the ﬁeld), or the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld strength (for the same tra- FIG. 12.1 Generating an induced voltage by moving a conductor through a magnetic ﬁeld. Conductor S eind N Motion Φ + – V Inductors 474  INDUCTORS versing speed), the greater will be the induced voltage across the con- ductor. If the conductor is held ﬁxed and the magnetic ﬁeld is moved so that its ﬂux lines cut the conductor, the same effect will be produced. If a coil of N turns is placed in the region of a changing ﬂux, as in Fig. 12.2, a voltage will be induced across the coil as determined by Faraday’s law: (volts, V) (12.1) where N represents the number of turns of the coil and df/dt is the instantaneous change in ﬂux (in webers) linking the coil. The term link- ing refers to the ﬂux within the turns of wire. The term changing sim- ply indicates that either the strength of the ﬁeld linking the coil changes in magnitude or the coil is moved through the ﬁeld in such a way that the number of ﬂux lines through the coil changes with time. If the ﬂux linking the coil ceases to change, such as when the coil simply sits still in a magnetic ﬁeld of ﬁxed strength, df/dt \u0001 0, and the induced voltage e \u0001 N(df/dt) \u0001 N(0) \u0001 0. 12.3 LENZ’S LAW In Section 11.2 it was shown that the magnetic ﬂux linking a coil of N turns with a current I has the distribution of Fig. 12.3. If the current increases in magnitude, the ﬂux linking the coil also increases. It was shown in Section 12.2, however, that a changing ﬂux linking a coil induces a voltage across the coil. For this coil, therefore, an induced voltage is developed across the coil due to the change in current through the coil. The polarity of this induced voltage tends to establish a current in the coil that produces a ﬂux that will oppose any change in the original ﬂux. In other words, the induced effect (eind) is a result of the increasing current through the coil. However, the resulting induced voltage will tend to establish a current that will oppose the increasing change in current through the coil. Keep in mind that this is all occurring simultaneously. The instant the current begins to increase in magnitude, there will be an opposing effect trying to limit the change. It is “choking” the change in current through the coil. Hence, the term choke is often applied to the inductor or coil. In fact, we will ﬁnd shortly that the current through a coil cannot change instanta- neously. A period of time determined by the coil and the resistance of the circuit is required before the inductor discontinues its opposition to a momentary change in current. Recall a similar situation for the volt- age across a capacitor in Chapter 10. The reaction above is true for increasing or decreasing levels of current through the coil. This effect is an example of a general principle known as Lenz’s law, which states that an induced effect is always such as to oppose the cause that produced it. 12.4 SELF-INDUCTANCE The ability of a coil to oppose any change in current is a measure of the self-inductance L of the coil. For brevity, the preﬁx self is usually dropped. Inductance is measured in henries (H), after the American physicist Joseph Henry (Fig. 12.4). e \u0001 N \u0002 d d f t \u0002 Changing flux e + – dφ dt φ FIG. 12.2 Demonstrating Faraday’s law.

American (Albany, NY; Princeton, NJ) (1797–1878) Physicist and Mathematician Professor of Natural Philosophy, Princeton University Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 59,054 In the early 1800s the title Professor of Natural Phi- losophy was applied to educators in the sciences. As a student and teacher at the Albany Academy, Henry performed extensive research in the area of electro- magnetism. He improved the design of electromag- nets by insulating the coil wire to permit a tighter wrap on the core. One of his earlier designs was capable of lifting 3600 pounds. In 1832 he discov- ered and delivered a paper on self-induction. This was followed by the construction of an effective elec- tric telegraph transmitter and receiver and extensive research on the oscillatory nature of lightning and discharges from a Leyden jar. In 1845 he was appointed the ﬁrst Secretary of the Smithsonian. TYPES OF INDUCTORS  475 Inductors are coils of various dimensions designed to introduce speciﬁed amounts of inductance into a circuit. The inductance of a coil varies directly with the magnetic properties of the coil. Ferromagnetic materials, therefore, are frequently employed to increase the inductance by increasing the ﬂux linking the coil. A close approximation, in terms of physical dimensions, for the inductance of the coils of Fig. 12.5 can be found using the following equation: (henries, H) (12.2) where N represents the number of turns; m, the permeability of the core (as introduced in Section 11.4; recall that m is not a constant but depends on the level of B and H since m \u0001 B/H); A, the area of the core in square meters; and l, the mean length of the core in meters. Substituting m \u0001 mrmo into Eq. (12.2) yields L \u0001\u0001 mr and (12.3) where Lo is the inductance of the coil with an air core. In other words, the inductance of a coil with a ferromagnetic core is the relative per- meability of the core times the inductance achieved with an air core. Equations for the inductance of coils different from those shown above can be found in reference handbooks. Most of the equations are more complex than those just described. EXAMPLE 12.1 Find the inductance of the air-core coil of Fig. 12.6.

Associated with every inductor are a resistance equal to the resistance of the turns and a stray capaci- (100 t) 2(4p \u0003 10 \u00047 Wb/A⋅m)(12.57 \u0003 10 \u00046 m 2)\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 0.1 m N 2mo A \u0002 l (p)(4 \u0003 10 \u00043 m) 2 \u0002\u0002 4 pd 2 \u0002 4 L \u0001 mr Lo N 2mo A \u0002 l N 2mrmo A \u0002\u0002 l L \u0001 \u0002 N 2 l mA \u0002 N turns l d A Magnetic or nonmagnetic core Solenoid (for >>10)l d (a) N turns Magnetic or nonmagnetic core l (b) Toroid A FIG. 12.5 Inductor conﬁgurations for which Equation (12.2) is appropriate. l = 100 mm d = 4 mm 100 turns Air (\u0001o)\u0001 FIG. 12.6 Example 12.1.

To include these effects, the equivalent circuit for the inductor is as shown in Fig. 12.7. However, for most applications considered in this text, the stray capacitance appearing in Fig. 12.7 can be ignored, resulting in the equivalent model of Fig. 12.8. The resistance Rl can play an important role in the analysis of networks with inductive elements. For most applications, we have been able to treat the capacitor as an ideal ele- ment and maintain a high degree of accuracy. For the inductor, however, Rl must often be included in the analysis and can have a pronounced effect on the response of a system (see Chapter 20, “Resonance”). The level of Rl can extend from a few ohms to a few hundred ohms. Keep in mind that the longer or thinner the wire used in the construction of the inductor, the greater will be the dc resistance as determined by R \u0001 rl / A. Our initial analysis will treat the inductor as an ideal element. Once a general feeling for the response of the element is established, the effects of Rl will be included. Symbols The primary function of the inductor, however, is to introduce induc- tance—not resistance or capacitance—into the network. For this reason, the symbols employed for inductance are as shown in Fig. 12.9. FIG. 12.7 Complete equivalent model for an inductor. FIG. 12.8 Practical equivalent model for an inductor. FIG. 12.9 Inductor symbols. Appearance All inductors, like capacitors, can be listed under two general headings: ﬁxed and variable. The ﬁxed air-core and iron-core inductors were described in the last section. The permeability-tuned variable coil has a ferromagnetic shaft that can be moved within the coil to vary the ﬂux linkages of the coil and thereby its inductance. Several ﬁxed and vari- able inductors appear in Fig. 12.10. Testing The primary reasons for inductor failure are shorts that develop between the windings and open circuits in the windings due to factors such as excessive currents, overheating, and age. The open-circuit con- dition can be checked easily with an ohmmeter (∞ ohms indication), but the short-circuit condition is harder to check because the resistance of many good inductors is relatively small and the shorting of a few wind- ings will not adversely affect the total resistance. Of course, if one is aware of the typical resistance of the coil, it can be compared to the (a) (f)(e)(d) (c) (b) TYPES OF INDUCTORS  477 measured value. A short between the windings and the core can be checked by simply placing one lead of the meter on one wire (terminal) and the other on the core itself. An indication of zero ohms reﬂects a short between the two because the wire that makes up the winding has an insulation jacket throughout. The universal LCR meter of Fig. 10.20 can be used to check the inductance level. Standard Values and Recognition Factor The standard values for inductors employ the same numerical multipli- ers used with resistors and inductors. Like the capacitor, the most com- mon employ the same numerical multipliers as the most common resis- tors, that is, those with the full range of tolerances (5%, 10%, and 20%), as appearing in Table 3.8. However, inductors are also readily available with the multipliers associated with the 5% and 10% resistors of Table 3.8. In general, therefore, expect to ﬁnd inductors with the fol- lowing multipliers: 0.1 mH, 0.12 mH, 0.15 mH, 0.18 mH, 0.22 mH, 0.27 mH, 0.33 mH, 0.39 mH, 0.47 mH, 0.56 mH, 0.68 mH, and 0.82 mH, and then 1 mH, 1.2 mH, 1.5 mH, 1.8 mH, 2.2 mH, 2.7 mH, and so on. Figure 12.11 was developed to establish a recognition factor when it comes to the various types and uses for inductors—in other words, to help the reader develop the skills to identify types of inductors, their typical range of values, and some of the most common applications. Figure 12.11 is certainly not all-inclusive, but it does offer a ﬁrst step in establishing a sense for what to expect for various applications. FIG. 12.10 Various types of inductors: (a) toroidal power inductor (1.4 mH to 5.6 mH) (courtesy of Microtan Co., Inc.); (b) surface-mount inductors on reels (0.1 mH through 1000 mH on 500-piece reels in 46 values) (courtesy of Bell Industries); (c) molded inductors (0.1 mH to 10 mH); (d) high-current ﬁlter inductors (24 mH at 60 A to 500 mH at 15 A); (e) toroid ﬁlter inductors (40 mH to 5 H); (f) air-core inductors (1 to 32 turns) for high-frequency applications. [Parts (c) through (f) courtesy of Dale Electronics, Inc.] 478  INDUCTORS 12.6 INDUCED VOLTAGE The inductance of a coil is also a measure of the change in ﬂux linking a coil due to a change in current through the coil; that is, (H) (12.4) where N is the number of turns, f is the ﬂux in webers, and i is the cur- rent through the coil. If a change in current through the coil fails to result in a signiﬁcant change in the ﬂux linking the coil through its cen- ter, the resulting inductance level will be relatively small. For this rea- son the inductance of a coil is sensitive to the point of operation on the hysteresis curve (described in detail in Section 11.8). If the coil is oper- ating on the steep slope, the change in ﬂux will be relatively high for a change in current through the coil. If the coil is operating near or in sat- uration, the change in ﬂux will be relatively small for the same change in current, resulting in a reduced level of inductance. This effect is par- ticularly important when we examine ac circuits since a dc level asso- L \u0001 N \u0002 d d f i \u0002 Type: Open Core Coil Typical Values: 3 mH to 40 mH Applications: Used in low-pass filter circuits.

Found in AM, FM, and UHF circuits. µ µ FIG. 12.11 Typical areas of application for inductive elements. INDUCED VOLTAGE  479 ciated with the applied ac signal may put the coil at or near saturation, and the resulting inductance level for the applied ac signal will be sig- niﬁcantly less than expected. You will ﬁnd that the maximum dc current is normally provided in supply manuals and data sheets to ensure avoid- ance of the saturation region. Equation (12.4) also reveals that the larger the inductance of a coil (with N ﬁxed), the larger will be the instantaneous change in ﬂux linking the coil due to an instantaneous change in current through the coil. If we write Eq. (12.1) as eL \u0001 N \u0001 \u0001N \u0002\u0001 \u0002 and substitute Eq. (12.4), we then have (V) (12.5) revealing that the magnitude of the voltage across an inductor is directly related to the inductance L and the instantaneous rate of change of cur- rent through the coil. Obviously, therefore, the greater the rate of change of current through the coil, the greater will be the induced volt- age. This certainly agrees with our earlier discussion of Lenz’s law. When induced effects are employed in the generation of voltages such as those available from dc or ac generators, the symbol e is appro- priate for the induced voltage. However, in network analysis the voltage across an inductor will always have a polarity such as to oppose the source that produced it, and therefore the following notation will be used throughout the analysis to come: (12.6) If the current through the coil fails to change at a particular instant, the induced voltage across the coil will be zero.

R-L TRANSIENTS: STORAGE CYCLE  481 the voltage across the coil is not determined solely by the magnitude of the change in current through the coil (Di), but also by the rate of change of current through the coil (Di/Dt). A similar statement was made for the current of a capacitor due to a change in voltage across the capacitor. A careful examination of Fig. 12.13 will also reveal that the area under the positive pulse from 2 ms to 4 ms equals the area under the negative pulse from 4 ms to 9 ms. In Section 12.13, we will ﬁnd that the area under the curves represents the energy stored or released by the inductor. From 2 ms to 4 ms, the inductor is storing energy, whereas from 4 ms to 9 ms, the inductor is releasing the energy stored. For the full period zero to 10 ms, energy has simply been stored and released; there has been no dissipation as experienced for the resistive elements. Over a full cycle, both the ideal capacitor and inductor do not consume energy but simply store and release it in their respective forms. 12.7 R-L TRANSIENTS: STORAGE CYCLE The changing voltages and current that result during the storing of energy in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld by an inductor in a dc circuit can best be described using the circuit of Fig. 12.14. At the instant the switch is closed, the inductance of the coil will prevent an instantaneous change in current through the coil. The potential drop across the coil, vL, will equal the impressed voltage E as determined by Kirchhoff’s voltage law since vR \u0001 iR \u0001 (0)R \u0001 0 V. The current iL will then build up from zero, establishing a voltage drop across the resistor and a cor- responding drop in vL. The current will continue to increase until the voltage across the inductor drops to zero volts and the full impressed voltage appears across the resistor. Initially, the current iL increases quite rapidly, followed by a continually decreasing rate until it reaches its maximum value of E/R. You will recall from the discussion of capacitors that a capacitor has a short-circuit equivalent when the switch is ﬁrst closed and an open- circuit equivalent when steady-state conditions are established. The inductor assumes the opposite equivalents for each stage. The instant the switch of Fig. 12.14 is closed, the equivalent network will appear as shown in Fig. 12.15. Note the correspondence with the earlier com- ments regarding the levels of voltage and current. The inductor obvi- ously meets all the requirements for an open-circuit equivalent: vL \u0001 E volts, and iL \u0001 0 A. When steady-state conditions have been established and the storage phase is complete, the “equivalent” network will appear as shown in Fig. 12.16. The network clearly reveals the following: An ideal inductor (Rl \u0001 0 \u0001) assumes a short-circuit equivalent in a dc network once steady-state conditions have been established. Fortunately, the mathematical equations for the voltages and current for the storage phase are similar in many respects to those encountered for the R-C network. The experience gained with these equations in Chapter 10 will undoubtedly make the analysis of R-L networks some- what easier to understand. – E + iL –+ vR vLL R FIG. 12.14 Basic R-L transient network.

A plot of the equation is given in Fig. 12.17, clearly indicating that the maximum steady-state value of iL is E/R, and that the rate of change in current decreases as time passes. The abscissa is scaled in time constants, with t for inductive circuits deﬁned by the following: (seconds, s) (12.9)t \u0001 \u0002 R L \u0002 iL \u0001 Im(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t ) \u0001 \u0002 E R \u0002(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/(L/R)) 0 1\u0002 2\u0002 3\u0002 4\u0002 5\u0002 t iL 0.632Im 0.865Im 0.951Im 0.981Im 0.993Im Im = E R (1 – e –t/(L/R))iL = E R \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 FIG. 12.17 Plotting the waveform for iL during the storage cycle. The fact that t has the units of time can be veriﬁed by taking the equation for the induced voltage vL \u0001 L and solving for L: L \u0001 which leads to the ratio t \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 t (s) Our experience with the factor (1 \u0004 e −t/t) veriﬁes the level of 63.2% after one time constant, 86.5% after two time constants, and so on. For convenience, Figure 10.29 is repeated as Fig. 12.18 to evaluate the functions (1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) and e \u0004t/t at various values of t. If we keep R constant and increase L, the ratio L/R increases and the rise time increases. The change in transient behavior for the current iL is plotted in Fig. 12.19 for various values of L. Note again the duality between these curves and those obtained for the R-C network in Fig. 10.32.

In addition, since L/R will always have some numerical value, even though it may be very small, the period 5t will always be greater than zero, conﬁrming the fact that the current cannot change instantaneously in an inductive network. In fact, the larger the inductance, the more the circuit will oppose a rapid buildup in current level. Figures 12.15 and 12.16 clearly reveal that the voltage across the coil jumps to E volts when the switch is closed and decays to zero volts with time. The decay occurs in an exponential manner, and vL during FIG. 12.18 Plotting the functions y \u0001 1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t and y \u0001 e \u0004t/t. 0 1t 2t 3t 4t 5t 6t 1.0 y 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 1t y = e – t/t 0.368 (close to )1 3 0.632 (close to )2 3 t y = 1 – e – t/\u0002 iLE R L1 L2 L3 L3 > L2 > L1 (R fixed) t (s) FIG. 12.19 Effect of L on the shape of the iL storage waveform. 484  INDUCTORS the storage phase can be described mathematically by the following equation: (12.10) A plot of vL appears in Fig. 12.20 with the time axis again divided into equal increments of t.

INITIAL VALUES  485 12.8 INITIAL VALUES This section will parallel Section 10.9 (Initial Values—Capacitors) on the effect of initial values on the transient phase. Since the current through a coil cannot change instantaneously, the current through a coil will begin the transient phase at the initial value established by the network (note Fig. 12.23) before the switch was closed. It will then pass through the transient phase until it reaches the steady-state (or ﬁnal)level after about ﬁve time constants. The steady-state level of the inductor current can be found by simply substituting its short- circuit equivalent (or Rl for the practical equivalent) and ﬁnding the resulting current through the element. Using the transient equation developed in the previous section, an equation for the current iL can be written for the entire time interval of Fig. 12.23; that is, iL \u0001 Ii \u0006 (If \u0004 Ii)(1 \u0004 e \u0004t/t) with (If \u0004 Ii) representing the total change during the transient phase. However, by multiplying through and rearranging terms: iL \u0001 Ii \u0006 If \u0004 If e \u0004t/t \u0004 Ii \u0006 Ii e \u0004t/t \u0001 If \u0004 If e \u0004t/t \u0006 Ii e \u0004t/t we ﬁnd (12.12) If you are required to draw the waveform for the current iL from ini- tial value to ﬁnal value, start by drawing a line at the initial value and steady-state levels, and then add the transient response (sensitive to the time constant) between the two levels. The following example will clar- ify the procedure. EXAMPLE 12.5 The inductor of Fig. 12.24 has an initial current level of 4 mA in the direction shown. (Speciﬁc methods to establish the ini- tial current will be presented in the sections and problems to follow.) a.

Since the current through the inductor is constant at 4 mA prior to the closing of the switch, the voltage (whose level is sensitive only to changes in current through the coil) must have an initial value of 0 V. At the instant the switch is closed, the current through the coil cannot change instantaneously, so the current through the resistive elements will be 4 mA. The resulting peak voltage at t \u0001 0 s can then be found using Kirchhoff’s voltage law as follows: Vm \u0001 E \u0004 VR1 \u0004 VR2 \u0001 16 V \u0004 (4 mA)(2.2 k\u0005) \u0004 (4 mA)(6.8 k\u0005) \u0001 16 V \u0004 8.8 V \u0004 27.2 V \u0001 16 V \u0004 36 V \u0001\u000420 V Note the minus sign to indicate that the polarity of the voltage vL is opposite to the deﬁned polarity of Fig. 12.24. The voltage will then decay (with the same time constant as the current iL)to zero because the inductor is approaching its short- circuit equivalence. The equation for vL is therefore: vL \u0001 \u000120e \u0001t/11.11 ms c. See Fig. 12.25. The initial and ﬁnal values of the current were drawn ﬁrst, and then the transient response was included between these levels. For the voltage, the waveform begins and ends at zero, with the peak value having a sign sensitive to the deﬁned polarity of vL in Fig. 12.24. 3 2 1 0 1τ 2τ 3τ 4τ 5τ 1.78 mA t (\u0001s) iL (mA) 4 mA τ τ τ τ τ \u0001 vL (volts) 0 V 1τ 2τ 3τ 4τ 5ττ τ τ τ τ –20 V 0 V 0 τ = 11.11 \u0001sτ \u0001 FIG. 12.25 iL and vL for the network of Fig. 12.24.

In R-L circuits, the energy is stored in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld established by the current through the coil. Unlike the capacitor, however, an isolated inductor cannot con- tinue to store energy since the absence of a closed path would cause the current to drop to zero, releasing the energy stored in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld. If the series R-L circuit of Fig. 12.26 had reached steady-state conditions and the switch were quickly opened, a spark would probably occur across the contacts due to the rapid change in current from a maximum of E/R to zero amperes. The change in current di/dt of the equation vL \u0001 L(di/dt) would establish a high voltage vL across the coil that in conjunction with the applied voltage E appears across the points of the switch. This is the same mechanism as applied in the ignition system of a car to ignite the fuel in the cylinder. Some 25,000 V are generated by the rapid decrease in ignition coil current that occurs when the switch in the system is opened. (In older systems, the “points” in the distributor served as the switch.) This inductive reac- tion is signiﬁcant when you consider that the only independent source in a car is a 12-V battery. If opening the switch to move it to another position will cause such a rapid discharge in stored energy, how can the decay phase of an R-L circuit be analyzed in much the same manner as for the R-C circuit? The solution is to use a network such as that appearing in Fig. 12.27(a). When the switch is closed, the voltage across the resistor R2 is E volts, and the R-L branch will respond in the same manner as described above, with the same waveforms and levels. A Thévenin net- work of E in parallel with R2 would simply result in the source as R-L TRANSIENTS: DECAY PHASE  487 E + – L vL – + vR = iRR = (0 A)R = 0 V R vcontact = vL + E +–vcontact iL 0 A FIG. 12.26 Demonstrating the effect of opening a switch in series with an inductor with a steady-state current.

After the storage phase has passed and steady-state conditions are established, the switch can be opened without the sparking effect or rapid discharge due to the resistor R2, which provides a complete path for the current iL. In fact, for clarity the discharge path is isolated in Fig. 12.28. The voltage vL across the inductor will reverse polarity and have a magnitude determined by (12.13) Recall that the voltage across an inductor can change instanta- neously but the current cannot. The result is that the current iL must maintain the same direction and magnitude as shown in Fig. 12.28. Therefore, the instant after the switch is opened, iL is still Im \u0001 E/R1, and vL \u0001\u0004(vR1 \u0006 vR2) \u0001\u0004(i1R1 \u0006 i2R2) \u0001\u0004iL(R1 \u0006 R2) \u0001 \u0004 (R1 \u0006 R2) \u0001\u0004\u0001 \u0006 \u0002E and (12.14) which is bigger than E volts by the ratio R2 /R1. In other words, when the switch is opened, the voltage across the inductor will reverse polar- ity and drop instantaneously from E to \u0004[1 \u0006 (R2 /R1)]E volts. As an inductor releases its stored energy, the voltage across the coil will decay to zero in the following manner: (12.15) with Vi \u0001 \u00011 \u0006 \u0002E and t′ \u0001\u0001 The current will decay from a maximum of Im \u0001 E/R1 to zero.

For the camera it was the important component that resulted in the high spike voltage across the trigger coil which was then magniﬁed by the autotransformer action of the secondary to generate the 4000 V nec- essary to ignite the ﬂash lamp. Recall that the capacitor in parallel with the trigger coil charged up to 300 V using the low-resistance path pro- vided by the SCR. However, once the capacitor was fully charged, the short-circuit path to ground provided by the SCR was removed, and the capacitor immediately started to discharge through the trigger coil. Since the only resistance in the time constant for the inductive network is the relatively low resistance of the coil itself, the current through the coil grew at a very rapid rate. A signiﬁcant voltage was then developed across the coil as deﬁned by Eq. (12.6): vL \u0001 L(di/dt). This voltage was in turn increased by transformer action to the secondary coil of the autotransformer, and the ﬂash lamp was ignited. That high voltage gen- erated across the trigger coil will also appear directly across the capac- itor of the trigger network. The result is that it will begin to charge up again until the generated voltage across the coil drops to zero volts. However, when it does drop, the capacitor will again discharge through the coil, establish another charging current through the coil, and again develop a voltage across the coil. The high-frequency exchange of energy between the coil and capacitor is called ﬂyback because of the “ﬂying back” of energy from one storage element to the other. It will begin to decay with time because of the resistive elements in the loop. 54 \u0002 2 1 \u0002 2 1 \u0002 2 15 V\u0002 5 \u0003 15 V\u0002\u0002 3 \u0003\u0004 2 \u0003 E\u0002 R1 \u0004 R2 500  INDUCTORS The more resistance, the more quickly it will die out. If the capacitor- inductor pairing were isolated and “tickled” along the way with the application of a dc voltage, the high frequency-generated voltage across the coil could be maintained and put to good use. In fact, it is this ﬂy- back effect that is used to generate a steady dc voltage (using rectiﬁca- tion to convert the oscillating waveform to one of a steady dc nature) that is commonly used in TVs. In the line conditioner, the primary purpose of the inductors is to “choke” out spikes of current that may come down the line using the effect described under the discussion of Lenz’s law in this chapter. Inductors are such that a rapidly changing current through a coil will result in the development of a current in the coil that will oppose the current that established the induced effect in the ﬁrst place. This effect is so strong that it can squelch current spikes of a signiﬁcant number of amperes in the line. An undesirable result in line conditioners, however, is the voltage across the coil that will develop when it “chokes” this rapidly changing current through the coil. However, as mentioned in Chapter 10, there are two coils in the system that will generate oppos- ing emf’s so that the net voltage to ground is zero. This is fairly clear when you carefully examine the two coils on the ferromagnetic core and note that they are wound in a way to develop opposing ﬁelds. The reaction of the coils in the line conditioner to different frequencies and their ability to help out with the blocking of EMI and RFI disturbances will have to wait until we discuss the effect of frequency on the reac- tion of an inductor in a later chapter. Household Dimmer Switch Inductors can be found in a wide variety of common electronic circuits in the home. The typical household dimmer uses an inductor to protect the other components and the applied load from “rush” currents—cur- rents that increase at very high rates and often to excessively high lev- els. This feature is particularly important for dimmers since they are most commonly used to control the light intensity of an incandescent lamp. At “turn on,” the resistance of incandescent lamps is typically very low, and relatively high currents may ﬂow for short periods of time until the ﬁlament of the bulb heats up. The inductor is also effective in blocking high-frequency noise (RFI) generated by the switching action of the triac in the dimmer. A capacitor is also normally included from line to neutral to prevent any voltage spikes from affecting the operation of the dimmer and the applied load (lamp, etc.) and to assist with the suppression of RFI disturbances. A photograph of one of the most common dimmers is provided in Fig. 12.50(a), with an internal view shown in Fig. 12.50(b). The basic components of most commercially available dimmers appear in the schematic of Fig. 12.50(c). In this design, a 14.5-mH inductor is used in the “choking” capacity described above, with a 0.068-mF capacitor for the “bypass” operation. Note the size of the inductor with its heavy wire and large ferromagnetic core and the relatively large size of the two 0.068-mF capacitors. Both suggest that they are designed to absorb high-energy disturbances. The general operation of the dimmer is shown in Fig. 12.51. The controlling network is in series with the lamp and will essentially act as an impedance that can vary between very low and very high levels: very low impedance levels resembling a short circuit so that the majority of APPLICATIONS  501 the applied voltage appears across the lamp [Fig. 12.51(a)] and very high impedances approaching open circuit where very little voltage appears across the lamp [Fig. 12.51(b)]. Intermediate levels of imped- ance will control the terminal voltage of the bulb accordingly. For instance, if the controlling network has a very high impedance (open- circuit equivalent) through half the cycle as shown in Fig. 12.51(c), the brightness of the bulb will be less than full voltage but not 50% due to the nonlinear relationship between the brightness of a bulb and the applied voltage. There is also a lagging effect present in the actual oper- ation of the dimmer, but this subject will have to wait until leading and lagging networks are examined in the ac chapters. The controlling knob, slide, or whatever other method is used on the face of the switch to control the light intensity is connected directly to the rheostat in the branch parallel to the triac. Its setting will determine FIG. 12.50 Dimmer control: (a) external appearance; (b) internal construction; (c) schematic. \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\b \u0004\u0006 \u0007\u000b\f\r \u000e \u000f\u000b\t\u0010 \u0011\u0005\t\b \u0007\u000b\f\u0013 \u0014\u0006\u000f \b\u000f\u000b\t\u0010 \u0015\u000b\t\u0010 \u0016\u0017˘\u0013ˇ \u000f\u0005\u0007\u000b\u0007\b\u0006\u000f ˆ˙ˆ˝˛˘˚˜ \u0010\t \t\u0010\u000b\b\u0006\u000f\u0007 !\u0016˙\"˘˚\u0011 \u000b\f# \u0010\b\u0006\u000f Feed + – 120 V ac Dimmer switch on/off 0.068 µF Return Lamp under control DIMMER G K ATRIAC DIAC 0.068 µF14.5 µH 330-k\u0001 rheostat 47 k\u0001 (c) 502  INDUCTORS when the voltage across the capacitor reaches a sufﬁciently high level to turn on the diac (a bidirectional diode) and establish a voltage at the gate (G) of the triac to turn it on. When it does, it will establish a very low resistance path from the anode (A) to the cathode (K), and the applied voltage will appear directly across the lamp. A more detailed explanation of this operation will appear in a later chapter following the examination of some important concepts for ac networks. During the period the SCR is off, its terminal resistance between anode and cath- ode will be very high and can be approximated by an open circuit. Dur- ing this period the applied voltage will not reach the load (lamp). Dur- ing such intervals the impedance of the parallel branch containing the rheostat, ﬁxed resistor, and capacitor is sufﬁciently high compared to the load that it can also be ignored, completing the open-circuit equiv- alent in series with the load. Note the placement of the elements in the photograph of Fig. 12.50 and the fact that the metal plate to which the triac is connected is actually a heat sink for the device. The on/off switch is in the same housing as the rheostat. The total design is cer- tainly well planned to maintain a relatively small size for the dimmer. Since the effort here is simply to control the amount of power get- ting to the load, the question is often asked, Why don’t we simply use a rheostat in series with the lamp? The question is best answered by examining Fig. 12.52, which shows a rather simple network with a rheostat in series with the lamp. At full wattage, a 60-W bulb on a 120-V line theoretically has an internal resistance of R \u0001 V 2/P (from the equa- tion P \u0001 V 2/R) \u0001 (120 V)2/60 W \u0001 240 \u0003.Although the resistance is sensitive to the applied voltage, we will assume this level for the following calculations. If we consider the case where the rheostat is set for the same level as the bulb, as shown in Fig. 12.52, there will be 60 V across the rheostat and the bulb. The power to each element will then be P \u0001 V 2/R \u0001 (60 V)2/240 \u0003\u0001 15 W. The bulb is certainly quite dim, but the rheostat inside the dimmer switch would be dissipating 15 W of power on a continuous basis. When you consider the size of a 2-W potentiometer in your laboratory, you can imagine the size rheostat you FIG. 12.51 Basic operation of the dimmer of Fig. 12.50: (a) full voltage to the lamp; (b) approaching the cutoff point for the bulb; (c) reduced illumination of the lamp.

APPLICATIONS  503 would need for 15 W, not to mention the purchase cost, although the biggest concern would probably be all the heat developed in the walls of the house. You would certainly be paying for electric power that would not be performing a useful function. Also, if you had four dim- mers set at the same level, you would actually be wasting sufﬁcient power to fully light another 60-W bulb. On occasion, especially when the lights are set very low by the dim- mer, a faint “singing” can sometimes be heard from the light bulb. This effect will sometimes occur when the conduction period of the dimmer is very small. The short, repetitive voltage pulse applied to the bulb will set the bulb into a condition that could be likened to a resonance (Chap- ter 20) state. The short pulses are just enough to heat up the ﬁlament and its supporting structures, and then the pulses are removed to allow the ﬁlament to cool down again for a longer period of time. This repet- itive heating and cooling cycle can set the ﬁlament in motion, and the “singing” can be heard in a quiet environment. Incidentally, the longer the ﬁlament, the louder the “singing.” A further condition for this effect is that the ﬁlament be in the shape of a coil and not a straight wire so that the “slinky” effect can develop. TV or PC Monitor Yolk Inductors and capacitors play a multitude of roles in the operation of a TV or PC monitor. However, the most obvious use of the coil is in the yolk assembly wrapped around the neck of the tube as shown in Fig. 12.53. As shown in the ﬁgure, the tube itself, in addition to providing the screen for viewing, is actually a large capacitor which plays an inte- gral part in establishing the high dc voltage for the proper operation of the monitor. A photograph of the yolk assembly of a black-and-white TV tube is provided in Fig. 12.54(a). It is constructed of four 28-mH coils with two sets of two coils connected at one point [Fig. 12.54(b)] so that they will share the same current and will establish the same magnetic ﬁeld. The purpose of the yolk assembly is to control the direction of the elec- tron beam from the cathode to the screen of the tube.

The placement of a very high positive potential (10 kV to 25 kV dc) to the conductive coating on the face of the tube will attract the emitted electrons at a very high speed and therefore at a high level of kinetic energy. When the electrons hit the phosphorescent coating (usually white, green, or amber) on the screen, light will be emitted which can be seen by some- one facing the monitor. The beam characteristics (such as intensity, focus, and shape) are controlled by a series of grids placed relatively close to the cathode in the neck of the tube. The grid is such that the negatively charged electrons can easily pass through, but the number and speed with which they pass can be controlled by a negative poten- tial applied to the grid. The grids cannot have a positive potential because the negatively charged electrons would be attracted to the grid structure and would eventually disintegrate from the high rate of con- duction. Negative potentials on the grids control the ﬂow of electrons by repulsion and by masking the attraction for the large positive poten- tial applied to the face of the tube. Once the beam has been established with the desired intensity and shape, it must be directed to a particular location on the screen using the yolk assembly. For vertical control, the two coils on the side estab- lish a magnetic ﬂux pattern as shown in Fig. 12.55(a). The resulting direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is from left to right as shown in Figs. 12.55(a) and 12.55(b). Using the right hand, with the index ﬁnger point- ing in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and the middle ﬁnger (at right angles to the index ﬁnger) in the direction of electron ﬂow, will result in the thumb (also at right angles to the index ﬁnger) pointing in the direction of the force on the electron beam. The result is a bending of the beam as shown in Fig. 12.53. The stronger the magnetic ﬁeld of the coils as determined by the current through the coils, the greater the deﬂection of the beam. Before continuing, it is important to realize that when the electron beam hits the phosphorescent screen as shown in Fig. 12.56, it is mov- ing with sufﬁcient velocity to cause a secondary emission of X rays that FIG. 12.55 Deﬂection coils: (a) vertical control; (b) right-hand-rule (RHR) for electron ﬂow.

Even though the X rays will die off exponentially with distance from the source, there is some concern about safety, and all modern-day monitors have shields all around the outside surface of the tube as shown in Fig. 12.56. It is therefore inter- esting that it is not the direct viewing that is of some concern but rather viewing by individuals to the side, above, or below the screen. Monitors are currently limited to 25 kV at the anode because the application of voltages in excess of 25 kV can result in a direct emission of X rays. Internally, all monitors currently have a safety shutoff to ensure that this level is never attained in the operating system. Time and space do not permit a detailed discussion of the full oper- ation of a monitor, but there are some facts about its operation that reveal the sophistication of the design. When an image is generated on a screen, it is done one pixel at a time along one horizontal line at a time. A pixel is one point on the screen. Pixels are black (no signal) or white (with signal) for black-and-white (monochromic) TVs or black and white or some color for color TVs. For EGA monitors the resolu- tion is 640 pixels wide and 35 pixels high, whereas VGA monitors are also 640 pixels wide but 480 pixels high. Obviously the more pixels in the same area, the sharper the image. A typical scan rate is 31.5 kHz which means that 31,500 lines can be drawn in 1 s, or one line of 640 pixels can be drawn in about 31.7 ms. Patterns on the screen are developed by the sequence of lines appear- ing in Fig. 12.57. Starting at the top left, the image moves across the screen down to the next line until it ends at the bottom right of the screen, at which point there is a rapid retrace (invisible) back to the starting point. Typical scanning rates (full image generated) extend from 60 frames per second to 80 frames per second. The slower the rate, the higher the possibility of ﬂickering in the images. At 60 frames per sec- ond, one entire frame is generated every 1/60 \u0001 16.67 ms \u0001 0.017 s. Color monitors are particularly interesting because all colors on the screen are generated by the colors red, blue, and green. The reason is that the human eye is responding to the wavelengths and energy levels of the various colors. The absence of any color is black, and the result of full energy to each of the three colors is white. The color yellow is a combi- nation of red and green with no blue, and pink is primarily red energy with smaller amounts of blue and green. An in-depth description of this “addi- tive” type of color generation must be left as an exercise for the reader. The fact that three colors deﬁne the resulting color requires that there be three cathodes in a color monitor to generate three electron beams. However, the three beams must sweep the screen in the same relative positions. Each pixel is now made up of three color dots in the same relative position for each pixel, as shown in Fig. 12.58. Each dot has a phosphorescent material that will generate the desired color when hit with an electron beam. For situations where the desired color has no green, the electron beam associated with the color green will be turned off. In fact, between each pixel, each beam is shut down to provide def- inition between the color pixels. The dots within the pixel are so close that the human eye cannot pick up the individual colors but simply the color that would result from the “additive” process. During the entire “on” time of a monitor, a full 10 kV to 25 kV are applied to the conductor on the screen to attract electrons. Over time there will naturally be an accumulation of negative charge on the screen which will remain after the power is turned off—a typical capacitive storage charge. For a brief period of time, it will sit with 25 kV across Shield Screen Secondary emission Shield Electron beam e FIG. 12.56 Secondary emission from and protective measures for a TV or PC monitor.

How- ever, the lack of a low-resistance path will often result in a storage of the charge for a fairly long period of time. This stored charge and the associated voltage across the plates are sufﬁciently high to cause severe damage. It is therefore paramount that TVs and monitors be repaired or investigated only by someone who is well versed in how to discharge the tube. One commonly applied procedure is to attach a long lead from the metal shaft of a ﬂat-edge screwdriver to a good ground connection. Then leave the anode connection to the tube in place, and simply insert the screwdriver under the cap until it touches the metal clip of the cap. You will probably hear a loud snap when discharge occurs. Because of the enormous amount of residual charge, it is recommended that the above procedure be repeated two or three times. Even then, treat the tube with a great deal of respect. In short, until you become familiar with the discharge procedure, leave the investigation of TVs and moni- tors to someone with the necessary experience. A further concern is the very high pulse voltages generated in an operating system. Be aware that they are of a magnitude that could destroy standard test equipment. The capacitive effect of the tube is an integral part of developing the high dc anode potential. Its ﬁltering action smooths out the repetitive, high-voltage pulses generated by the ﬂyback action of the TV. Other- wise, the screen would simply be a ﬂickering pattern as the anode potential switched on and off with the pulsating signal. 12.16 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Transient RL Response The computer analysis will begin with a transient analysis of the network of parallel inductive elements in Fig. 12.59. The inductors are picked up from the ANALOG library in the Place Part dialog box. As noted in Fig. 12.59, the inductor is displayed with its terminal identiﬁcation which is helpful for identifying nodes when calling for speciﬁc output plots and values. In general, when an element is ﬁrst placed on a schematic, the number 1 is assigned to the left end on a horizontal display and to the top on a vertical display. Similarly, the number 2 is assigned to the right end of an element in the horizontal position and to the bottom in the vertical position. Be aware, however, that the option Rotate rotates the element in the CCW direc- tion, so taking a horizontal resistor to the vertical position requires three rotations to get the number 1 to the top again. In previous chap- ters you may have noted that a number of the outputs were taken off terminal 2 because a single rotation placed this terminal at the top of the vertical display. Also note in Fig. 12.59 the need for a series resis- tor Rl within the parallel loop of inductors. In PSpice, inductors must have a series resistor to reﬂect real-world conditions. The chosen value of1m\u0001 is so small, however, that it will not affect the response of the system. For VPulse, the rise time was selected as 0.01 ms, and the pulse width was chosen as 10 ms because the time constant of the net- work is t \u0001 LT /R \u0001 (4 H \u0001 12 H)/2 k\u0001 \u0001 1.5 ms and 5t \u0001 7.5 ms. The simulation is the same as applied when obtaining the transient response of capacitive networks. In condensed form, the sequence to obtain a plot of the voltage across the coils versus time is as follows: New SimulationProﬁlekey-TransientRL-Create-TimeDomain(Transient)- Run to time:10ms-Start saving data after:0s and Maximum step size:5ms-OK-Run PSpice key-Add Trace key-V1(L2)-OK. The result- COMPUTER ANALYSIS  507 ing trace appears in the bottom of Fig. 12.60. A maximum step size of 5 mswas chosen to ensure that it was less than the rise or fall times of 10 ms. Note that the voltage across the coil jumps to the 50-V level almost immediately; then it decays to 0 V in about 8 ms. A plot of the total cur- rent through the parallel coils can be obtained through Plot-Plot to Win- dow-Add Trace key-I(R)-OK, resulting in the trace appearing at the top of Fig. 12.60. When the trace ﬁrst appeared, the vertical scale extended from 0 A to 40 mA even though the maximum value of iR was 25 mA. To bring the maximum value to the top of the graph, Plot was selected fol- lowed by Axis Settings-Y Axis-User Deﬁned-0A to 25mA-OK. For values, the voltage plot was selected, SEL\u0001\u0001, followed by the Toggle cursor key and a click on the screen to establish the crosshairs. The left-click cursor was set on one time constant to reveal a value of 18.461 V for A1 (about 36.8% of the maximum as deﬁned by the expo- nential waveform). The right-click cursor was set at 7.5 ms or ﬁve time constants, resulting in a relatively low 0.338 V for A2. Transient Response with Initial Conditions The next applica- tion will verify the results of Example 12.5 which has an initial condi- tion associated with the inductive element. VPULSE is again employed with the parameters appearing in Fig. 12.61. Since t \u0001 L/R \u0001 100 mH/ (2.2 k\u0001 \u0004 6.8 k\u0001) \u0001 100 mH/9 k\u0001 \u0001 11.11 ms and 5t \u0001 55.55 ms, the pulse width (PW) was set to 100 ms. The rise and fall times were set at 100 ms/1000 \u0001 0.1 ms. Note again that the labels 1 and 2 appear with the inductive element. Setting the initial conditions for the inductor requires a procedure that has not been described as yet. First double-click on the inductor symbol to obtain the Property Editor dialog box. Then select Parts at FIG. 12.59 Using PSpice to obtain the transient response of a parallel inductive network due to an applied pulse of 50 V. 508  INDUCTORS the bottom of the dialog box, and select New Column to obtain the Add New Column dialog box. Under Name, enter IC (an abbreviation for “initial condition”—not “capacitive current”) followed by the initial condition of 4 mA under Value; then click OK. The Property Editor dialog box will appear again, but now the initial condition appears as a New Column in the horizontal listing dedicated to the inductive ele- ment. Now select Display to obtain the Display Properties dialog box, and under Display Format choose Name and Value so that both IC and 4mA will appear. Click OK, and we return to the Property Editor dialog box. Finally, click on Apply and exit the dialog box (X). The result is the display of Fig. 12.61 for the inductive element. Now for the simulation. First select the New Simulation Proﬁle key, insert the name InitialCond(L), and follow up with Create. Then in the Simulation Settings dialog box, select Time Domain(Transient) for the Analysis type and General Settings for the Options. The Run to time should be 200 ms so that we can see the full effect of the pulse source on the transient response. The Start saving data after should remain at 0 s, and the Maximum step size should be 200 ms/1000 \u0001 200 ns. Click OK and then select the Run PSpice key. The result will be a screen with an x-axis extending from 0 to 200 ms. Selecting Trace to get to the Add Traces dialog box and then selecting I(L) followed by OK will result in the display of Fig. 12.62. The plot for I(L) clearly starts at the initial value of 4 mA and then decays to 1.78 mA as deﬁned by the left-click cursor. The right-click cursor reveals that the current has dropped to 0.222 mA (essentially 0 A) after the pulse source has dropped to 0 V for 100 ms. The VPulse source was placed in the same ﬁgure through Plot-Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace- V(VPulse:\u0001)-OK to permit a comparison between the applied voltage and the resulting inductor current.

The circuit to be examined appears in Fig. 12.63 with a pulse voltage source to simulate the closing of a switch at t \u0001 0 s. The source, referred to as PULSE–VOLTAGE–SOURCE in the Source listing, is the near the bottom left of the Sources parts bin. When selected, it will appear with a label, an initial voltage, a step volt- age, and a frequency. All can be changed by simply double-clicking on the source symbol to obtain the Pulse Voltage dialog box. As shown in Fig. 12.63, the Pulsed Value will be set at 20 V, and the Delay Time to 0 s. The Rise Time and Fall Time will both remain at the default lev- els of 1 ns. For our analysis we want a Pulse Width that is at least twice the 5t transient period of the circuit. For the chosen values of R and L, t \u0001 L/R \u0001 10 mH/100 \u0001 \u0001 0.1 ms \u0001 100 ms. The transient period of 5t is therefore 500 ms or 0.5 ms. Thus, a Pulse Width of 1 ms would seem appropriate with a Period of 2 ms. The result is a fre- quency of f \u0001 1/T \u0001 1/2 ms \u0001 500 Hz. When all have been set and selected, the parameters of the pulse source will appear as shown in Fig. 12.63. Next the resistor, inductor, and ground are placed on the screen to complete the circuit. This time we will want to see the node names so that we can call for them when we set up the simulation process. This is accomplished through Options-Preferences-Show node names. In this case we have two—one at the positive terminal of the supply (1) and the other at the top end of the inductor (2) representing the voltage across the inductor. The simulation process is initiated by the following sequence: Sim- ulate-Analyses-Transient Analysis. The result is the Transient Analy- sis dialog box in which Analysis Parameters is chosen ﬁrst. Under FIG. 12.63 Using Electronics Workbench to obtain the transient response for an inductive circuit. PROBLEMS  511 Parameters, use 0 s as the Start time and 4 ms as the End time so that we get two full cycles of the applied voltage. After enabling the Maxi- mum time step settings(TMAX), we set the Minimum number of time points at 1000 to get a reasonably good plot during the rapidly changing transient period. Next, the Output variables section must be selected and the program told which voltage and current levels we are interested in. On the left side of the dialog box is a list of Variables that have been deﬁned for the circuit. On the right is a list of Selected vari- ables for analysis. In between you see a Plot during simulation or Remove. To move a variable from the left to the right column, simply select it in the left column and choose Plot during simulation. It will then appear in the right column. For our purposes it seems appropriate that we plot both the applied voltage and the voltage across the coil, so 1 and 2 were moved to the right column. Then Simulate is selected, and a window titled Analysis Graphs will appear with the selected plots as shown in Fig. 12.63. Click on the Show/Hide Grid key (a red grid on a black axis), and the grid lines will appear. Then selecting the Show/Hide Legend key on the immediate right will result in the small Transient Anal dialog box that will identify the color that goes with each nodal voltage. In our case, blue is the color of the applied voltage, and red is the color of the voltage across the coil. The source voltage appears as expected with its transition to 20 V, 50% duty cycle, and the period of 2 ms. The voltage across the coil jumped immediately to the 20-V level and then began its decay to 0 V in about 0.5 ms as predicted. When the source voltage dropped to zero, the voltage across the coil reversed polarity to maintain the same direction of current in the inductive circuit. Remember that for a coil, the voltage can change instantaneously, but the inductor will “choke” any instantaneous change in current. By reversing its polarity, the voltage across the coil ensures the same polarity of voltage across the resistor and therefore the same direction of current through the coil and circuit.

GLOSSARY Choke A term often applied to an inductor, due to the ability of an inductor to resist a change in current through it. Faraday’s law A law relating the voltage induced across a coil to the number of turns in the coil and the rate at which the ﬂux linking the coil is changing. Inductor A fundamental element of electrical systems con- structed of numerous turns of wire around a ferromagnetic core or an air core. Lenz’s law A law stating that an induced effect is always such as to oppose the cause that produced it. Self-inductance (L)A measure of the ability of a coil to oppose any change in current through the coil and to store energy in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld in the region sur- rounding the coil. 13 13.1 INTRODUCTION The analysis thus far has been limited to dc networks, networks in which the currents or voltages are ﬁxed in magnitude except for tran- sient effects. We will now turn our attention to the analysis of networks in which the magnitude of the source varies in a set manner. Of partic- ular interest is the time-varying voltage that is commercially available in large quantities and is commonly called the ac voltage. (The letters ac are an abbreviation for alternating current.) To be absolutely rigor- ous, the terminology ac voltage or ac current is not sufﬁcient to describe the type of signal we will be analyzing. Each waveform of Fig. 13.1 is an alternating waveform available from commercial supplies. The term alternating indicates only that the waveform alternates between two prescribed levels in a set time sequence (Fig. 13.1). To be 0 t v Triangular wave 0 t v Square wave 0 t v Sinusoidal FIG. 13.1 Alternating waveforms. absolutely correct, the term sinusoidal, square wave, or triangular must also be applied. The pattern of particular interest is the sinusoidal ac waveform for voltage of Fig. 13.1. Since this type of signal is encoun- tered in the vast majority of instances, the abbreviated phrases ac volt- age and ac current are commonly applied without confusion. For the other patterns of Fig. 13.1, the descriptive term is always present, but frequently the ac abbreviation is dropped, resulting in the designation square-wave or triangular waveforms. Sinusoidal Alternating Waveforms 522  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS One of the important reasons for concentrating on the sinusoidal ac voltage is that it is the voltage generated by utilities throughout the world. Other reasons include its application throughout electrical, elec- tronic, communication, and industrial systems. In addition, the chapters to follow will reveal that the waveform itself has a number of charac- teristics that will result in a unique response when it is applied to the basic electrical elements. The wide range of theorems and methods introduced for dc networks will also be applied to sinusoidal ac sys- tems. Although the application of sinusoidal signals will raise the required math level, once the notation given in Chapter 14 is under- stood, most of the concepts introduced in the dc chapters can be applied to ac networks with a minimum of added difﬁculty. The increasing number of computer systems used in the industrial community requires, at the very least, a brief introduction to the termi- nology employed with pulse waveforms and the response of some fun- damental conﬁgurations to the application of such signals. Chapter 24 will serve such a purpose. 13.2 SINUSOIDAL ac VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS Generation Sinusoidal ac voltages are available from a variety of sources. The most common source is the typical home outlet, which provides an ac voltage that originates at a power plant; such a power plant is most commonly fueled by water power, oil, gas, or nuclear fusion. In each case an ac generator (also called an alternator), as shown in Fig. 13.2(a), is the primary component in the energy-conversion process. (e)(d)(c)(b)(a) Inverter FIG. 13.2 Various sources of ac power: (a) generating plant; (b) portable ac generator; (c) wind-power station; (d) solar panel; (e) function generator. The power to the shaft developed by one of the energy sources listed will turn a rotor (constructed of alternating magnetic poles) inside a set of windings housed in the stator (the stationary part of the dynamo) and will induce a voltage across the windings of the stator, as deﬁned by Faraday’s law, SINUSOIDAL ac VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS  523 e \u0001 N Through proper design of the generator, a sinusoidal ac voltage is developed that can be transformed to higher levels for distribution through the power lines to the consumer. For isolated locations where power lines have not been installed, portable ac generators [Fig. 13.2(b)] are available that run on gasoline. As in the larger power plants, however, an ac generator is an integral part of the design. In an effort to conserve our natural resources, wind power and solar energy are receiving increasing interest from various districts of the world that have such energy sources available in level and duration that make the conversion process viable. The turning propellers of the wind-power sta- tion [Fig. 13.2(c)] are connected directly to the shaft of an ac generator to provide the ac voltage described above. Through light energy absorbed in the form of photons, solar cells [Fig. 13.2(d)] can generate dc voltages. Through an electronic package called an inverter, the dc voltage can be converted to one of a sinusoidal nature. Boats, recreational vehicles (RVs), etc., make frequent use of the inversion process in isolated areas. Sinusoidal ac voltages with characteristics that can be controlled by the user are available from function generators, such as the one in Fig. 13.2(e). By setting the various switches and controlling the position of the knobs on the face of the instrument, one can make available sinu- soidal voltages of different peak values and different repetition rates. The function generator plays an integral role in the investigation of the variety of theorems, methods of analysis, and topics to be introduced in the chapters that follow. Deﬁnitions The sinusoidal waveform of Fig. 13.3 with its additional notation will now be used as a model in deﬁning a few basic terms. These terms, however, can df\u0002 dt Max e 0 t1 e1 T3 Ep – pt T2T1 Em t2 Em Max e2 FIG. 13.3 Important parameters for a sinusoidal voltage. be applied to any alternating waveform. It is important to remember as you proceed through the various deﬁnitions that the vertical scaling is in volts or amperes and the horizontal scaling is always in units of time. Waveform: The path traced by a quantity, such as the voltage in Fig. 13.3, plotted as a function of some variable such as time (as above), position, degrees, radians, temperature, and so on.

Frequency ( f ): The number of cycles that occur in 1 s. The fre- quency of the waveform of Fig. 13.5(a) is 1 cycle per second, and for Fig. 13.5(b), 21⁄2 cycles per second. If a waveform of similar shape had a period of 0.5 s [Fig. 13.5(c)], the frequency would be 2 cycles per second. FIG. 13.5 Demonstrating the effect of a changing frequency on the period of a sinusoidal waveform. Instantaneous value: The magnitude of a waveform at any instant of time; denoted by lowercase letters (e1, e2). Peak amplitude: The maximum value of a waveform as measured from its average, or mean, value, denoted by uppercase letters (such as Em for sources of voltage and Vm for the voltage drop across a load). For the waveform of Fig. 13.3, the average value is zero volts, and Em is as deﬁned by the ﬁgure. Peak value: The maximum instantaneous value of a function as measured from the zero-volt level. For the waveform of Fig. 13.3, the peak amplitude and peak value are the same, since the average value of the function is zero volts. Peak-to-peak value: Denoted by Ep-p or Vp-p, the full voltage between positive and negative peaks of the waveform, that is, the sum of the magnitude of the positive and negative peaks. Periodic waveform: A waveform that continually repeats itself after the same time interval. The waveform of Fig. 13.3 is a periodic waveform. Period (T ): The time interval between successive repetitions of a periodic waveform (the period T1 \u0001 T2 \u0001 T3 in Fig. 13.3), as long as successive similar points of the periodic waveform are used in deter- mining T. Cycle: The portion of a waveform contained in one period of time. The cycles within T1, T2, and T3 of Fig. 13.3 may appear different in Fig. 13.4, but they are all bounded by one period of time and there- fore satisfy the deﬁnition of a cycle. SINUSOIDAL ac VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS  525 The unit of measure for frequency is the hertz (Hz), where (13.1) The unit hertz is derived from the surname of Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (Fig. 13.6), who did original research in the area of alternating currents and voltages and their effect on the basic R, L, and C elements. The fre- quency standard for North America is 60 Hz, whereas for Europe it is predominantly 50 Hz. As with all standards, any variation from the norm will cause dif- ﬁculties. In 1993, Berlin, Germany, received all its power from east- ern plants, whose output frequency was varying between 50.03 and 51 Hz. The result was that clocks were gaining as much as 4 min- utes a day. Alarms went off too soon, VCRs clicked off before the end of the program, etc., requiring that clocks be continually reset. In 1994, however, when power was linked with the rest of Europe, the precise standard of 50 Hz was reestablished and everyone was on time again. Using a log scale (described in detail in Chapter 23), a frequency spectrum from 1 Hz to 1000 GHz can be scaled off on the same axis, as shown in Fig. 13.7. A number of terms in the various spectrums are probably familiar to the reader from everyday experiences. Note that the audio range (human ear) extends from only 15 Hz to 20 kHz, but the transmission of radio signals can occur between 3 kHz and 300 GHz. The uniform process of deﬁning the intervals of the radio-frequency spectrum from VLF to EHF is quite evident from the length of the bars in the ﬁgure (although keep in mind that it is a log scale, so the fre- quencies encompassed within each segment are quite different). Other frequencies of particular interest (TV, CB, microwave, etc.) are also included for reference purposes. Although it is numerically easy to talk about frequencies in the megahertz and gigahertz range, keep in mind that a frequency of 100 MHz, for instance, represents a sinusoidal waveform that passes through 100,000,000 cycles in only 1 s—an incredible number when we compare it to the 60 Hz of our conventional power sources. The new Pentium II chip manufactured by Intel can run at speeds up to 450 MHz. Imagine a product able to handle 450,000,000 instructions per second—an incredible achievement. The new Pentium IV chip manufactured by Intel can run at a speed of 1.5 GHz. Try to imagine a product able to handle 1,500,000,000,000 instructions in just 1 s—an incredible achievement. Since the frequency is inversely related to the period—that is, as one increases, the other decreases by an equal amount—the two can be related by the following equation: f \u0001 Hz T \u0001 seconds (s) (13.2) or (13.3)T \u0001 \u0002 1 f \u0002 f \u0001 \u0002 T 1 \u0002 1 hertz (Hz) \u0001 1 cycle per second (c/s) FIG. 13.6 Heinrich Rudolph Hertz. German (Hamburg, Berlin, Karlsruhe) (1857–94) Physicist Professor of Physics, Karlsruhe Polytechnic and University of Bonn Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 66,606 Spurred on by the earlier predictions of the English physicist James Clerk Maxwell, Heinrich Hertz pro- duced electromagnetic waves in his laboratory at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic while in his early 30s. The rudimentary transmitter and receiver were in es- sence the ﬁrst to broadcast and receive radio waves. He was able to measure the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves and conﬁrmed that the ve- locity of propagation is in the same order of magni- tude as light. In addition, he demonstrated that the reﬂective and refractive properties of electromag- netic waves are the same as those for heat and light waves. It was indeed unfortunate that such an inge- nious, industrious individual should pass away at the very early age of 37 due to a bone disease. 526  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS Microwave Microwave oven LF VLF 3 kHz – 30 kHz (Very Low Freq.) 30 kHz – 300 kHz (Low Freq.) 300 kHz – 3 MHz (Medium Freq.) 3 MHz – 30 MHz (High Freq.) 30 MHz – 300 MHz (Very High Freq.) 300 MHz – 3 GHz (Ultrahigh Freq.) 3 GHz – 30 GHz (Super-High Freq.) 30 GHz – 300 GHz (Extremely High Freq.)

In each case, the polarity and current direction will be for an instant of time in the positive portion of the sinusoidal waveform. This is shown in Fig. 13.10 with the symbols for the sinusoidal ac voltage and current. A lowercase letter is employed for each to indicate that the quantity is time dependent; that is, its magnitude will change with time. 0.1 V\u0002 div. 1\u0002\u0002 200 \u0004 10 \u00036 s 50 ms\u0002 div. 1\u0002\u0002 20 \u0004 10 \u00033 s 1 \u0002 T 1\u0002 1000 Hz 1 \u0002 f 1\u0002 60 Hz 1 \u0002 f 0 t (ms) 10 V e 515 25 35 FIG. 13.8 Example 13.2.

Note in the last sentence the absence of the term sinusoidal before the phrase ac net- works. This phrase will be used to an increasing degree as we progress; sinusoidal is to be understood unless otherwise indicated. 13.3 THE SINE WAVE The terms deﬁned in the previous section can be applied to any type of periodic waveform, whether smooth or discontinuous. The sinusoidal waveform is of particular importance, however, since it lends itself readily to the mathematics and the physical phenomena associated with electric circuits. Consider the power of the following statement: The sinusoidal waveform is the only alternating waveform whose shape is unaffected by the response characteristics of R, L, and C elements. In other words, if the voltage across (or current through) a resistor, coil, or capacitor is sinusoidal in nature, the resulting current (or volt- age, respectively) for each will also have sinusoidal characteristics, as shown in Fig. 13.11. If a square wave or a triangular wave were applied, such would not be the case. The unit of measurement for the horizontal axis of Fig. 13.12 is the degree. A second unit of measurement frequently used is the radian (rad). It is deﬁned by a quadrant of a circle such as in Fig. 13.13 where the distance subtended on the circumference equals the radius of the circle. If we deﬁne x as the number of intervals of r (the radius) around the circumference of the circle, then C \u0001 2pr \u0001 x ⋅ r and we ﬁnd x \u0001 2p Therefore, there are 2p rad around a 360° circle, as shown in Fig. 13.14, and (13.4)2p rad \u0001 360° + – i t vR, L, or C t FIG. 13.11 The sine wave is the only alternating waveform whose shape is not altered by the response characteristics of a pure resistor, inductor, or capacitor.

FIG. 13.14 There are 2p radians in one full circle of 360°. THE SINE WAVE  529 with (13.5) A number of electrical formulas contain a multiplier of p. For this reason, it is sometimes preferable to measure angles in radians rather than in degrees. The quantity p is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. p has been determined to an extended number of places primarily in an attempt to see if a repetitive sequence of numbers appears. It does not. A sampling of the effort appears below: p \u0001 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 . . . Although the approximation p \u0001 3.14 is often applied, all the calcula- tions in this text will use the p function as provided on all scientiﬁc cal- culators. For 180° and 360°, the two units of measurement are related as shown in Fig. 13.14. The conversion equations between the two are the following: Radians \u0001 \u0002\u0002 18 p 0° \u0002\u0003 \u0004 (degrees) (13.6) Degrees \u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0004 (radians) (13.7) Applying these equations, we ﬁnd 90°: Radians \u0001 (90°) \u0001 rad 30°: Radians \u0001 (30°) \u0001 rad rad: Degrees \u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0001 60° rad: Degrees \u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0001 270° Using the radian as the unit of measurement for the abscissa, we would obtain a sine wave, as shown in Fig. 13.15. It is of particular interest that the sinusoidal waveform can be derived from the length of the vertical projection of a radius vector rotating in a uniform circular motion about a ﬁxed point. Starting as shown in Fig. 13.16(a) and plotting the amplitude (above and below zero) on the coordinates drawn to the right [Figs. 13.16(b) through (i)], we will trace a complete sinusoidal waveform after the radius vector has completed a 360° rotation about the center. The velocity with which the radius vector rotates about the center, called the angular velocity, can be determined from the following equation: Angular velocity \u0001 (13.8) distance (degrees or radians)\u0002\u0002\u0002 time (seconds) 3p \u0002 2 180°\u0002 p 3p \u0002 2 p \u0002 3 180°\u0002 p p \u0002 3 p \u0002 6 p\u0002 180° p \u0002 2 p\u0002 180° 180°\u0002 p 1 rad \u0001 57.296° \u0001 57.3° Sine wave v, i, etc. 0 \u0002 4 \u0002 2 4 3\u0002 \u0002 4 5\u0002 2 3\u0002 4 7\u0002 2\u0002 (rad)\u0003 FIG. 13.15 Plotting a sine wave versus radians. 0° 45° 90° 135° 180° 225° 270° 315° 360° T (period) Sine wave (i) α α = 360° 0° 315° (h) α α = 315° 0° (g) α α = 270° 270° 0° (f) α α = 225° 225° 0° (e) α α = 180° 180° 0° (d) α α = 135° 45° 90° 135° 0° (c) α α = 90° 90° 0° (b) α α = 45° 45° Note equality 0° (a) αα = 0° 530  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS FIG. 13.16 Generating a sinusoidal waveform through the vertical projection of a rotating vector. THE SINE WAVE  531 Substituting into Eq. (13.8) and assigning the Greek letter omega (q) to the angular velocity, we have (13.9) and (13.10) Since q is typically provided in radians per second, the angle a obtained using Eq. (13.10) is usually in radians. If a is required in degrees, Equation (13.7) must be applied. The importance of remem- bering the above will become obvious in the examples to follow. In Fig. 13.16, the time required to complete one revolution is equal to the period (T) of the sinusoidal waveform of Fig. 13.16(i). The radi- ans subtended in this time interval are 2p. Substituting, we have (rad/s) (13.11) In words, this equation states that the smaller the period of the sinusoidal waveform of Fig. 13.16(i), or the smaller the time interval before one complete cycle is generated, the greater must be the angu- lar velocity of the rotating radius vector. Certainly this statement agrees with what we have learned thus far. We can now go one step further and apply the fact that the frequency of the generated wave- form is inversely related to the period of the waveform; that is, f \u0001 1/T. Thus, (rad/s) (13.12) This equation states that the higher the frequency of the generated sinusoidal waveform, the higher must be the angular velocity. Equations (13.11) and (13.12) are veriﬁed somewhat by Fig. 13.17, where for the same radius vector, q \u0001 100 rad/s and 500 rad/s.

The equation a \u0001 qt states that the angle a through which the rotat- ing vector of Fig. 13.16 will pass is determined by the angular velocity of the rotating vector and the length of time the vector rotates. For example, for a particular angular velocity (ﬁxed q), the longer the radius vector is permitted to rotate (that is, the greater the value of t), the greater will be the number of degrees or radians through which the vector will pass. Relating this statement to the sinusoidal waveform, for a particular angular velocity, the longer the time, the greater the num- GENERAL FORMAT FOR THE SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE OR CURRENT  533 ber of cycles shown. For a ﬁxed time interval, the greater the angular velocity, the greater the number of cycles generated. Due to Eq. (13.10), the general format of a sine wave can also be written (13.14) with qt as the horizontal unit of measure. For electrical quantities such as current and voltage, the general for- mat is i \u0001 Im sin qt \u0001 Im sin a e \u0001 Em sin qt \u0001 Em sin a where the capital letters with the subscript m represent the amplitude, and the lowercase letters i and e represent the instantaneous value of current or voltage, respectively, at any time t. This format is particularly important since it presents the sinusoidal voltage or current as a func- tion of time, which is the horizontal scale for the oscilloscope. Recall that the horizontal sensitivity of a scope is in time per division and not degrees per centimeter. EXAMPLE 13.8 Given e \u0001 5 sin a, determine e at a \u0001 40° and a \u0001 0.8p . Solution: For a \u0001 40°, e \u0001 5 sin 40° \u0001 5(0.6428) \u0001 3.214 V For a \u0001 0.8p, a (°) \u0001 (0.8p) \u0001 144° and e \u0001 5 sin 144° \u0001 5(0.5878) \u0001 2.939 V The conversion to degrees will not be required for most modern-day scientiﬁc calculators since they can perform the function directly. First, be sure that the calculator is in the RAD mode. Then simply enter the radian measure and use the appropriate trigonometric key (sin, cos, tan, etc.). The angle at which a particular voltage level is attained can be determined by rearranging the equation e \u0001 Em sin a in the following manner: sin a \u0001 which can be written (13.15) Similarly, for a particular current level, (13.16) The function sin\u00031 is available on all scientiﬁc calculators. a \u0001 sin \u00031 \u0002 I i m \u0002 a \u0001 sin \u00031 \u0002 E e m \u0002 e \u0002 Em 180°\u0002 p Am sin qt 0 α (rad)απ 2 —π 6 — π3 2 — π π2 10 e 10 10 0° 30° 90° 180° 270° 360° α (°)α e 10 534  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS EXAMPLE 13.9 a.

The second intersection is determined by a2 \u0001 180° \u0003 23.578° \u0001 156.422° In general, therefore, keep in mind that Equations (13.15) and (13.16) will provide an angle with a magnitude between 0° and 90°. b. Eq. (13.10): a \u0001 qt, and so t \u0001 a/q. However, a must be in radians. Thus, a (rad) \u0001 (23.578°) \u0001 0.411 rad and t1 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 1.09 ms For the second intersection, a (rad) \u0001 (156.422°) \u0001 2.73 rad t2 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 7.24 ms The sine wave can also be plotted against time on the horizontal axis. The time period for each interval can be determined from t \u0001 a/q, but the most direct route is simply to ﬁnd the period T from T \u0001 1/f and break it up into the required intervals. This latter technique will be demonstrated in Example 13.10. Before reviewing the example, take special note of the relative sim- plicity of the mathematical equation that can represent a sinusoidal waveform. Any alternating waveform whose characteristics differ from those of the sine wave cannot be represented by a single term, but may require two, four, six, or perhaps an inﬁnite number of terms to be rep- resented accurately. Additional description of nonsinusoidal waveforms can be found in Chapter 25.

If the waveform is shifted to the right or left of 0°,the expression becomes (13.17) where v is the angle in degrees or radians that the waveform has been shifted. If the waveform passes through the horizontal axis with a positive- going (increasing with time) slope before 0°, as shown in Fig. 13.23, the expression is (13.18) At qt \u0001 a \u0001 0°, the magnitude is determined by Am sin v. If the wave- form passes through the horizontal axis with a positive-going slope after 0°, as shown in Fig. 13.24, the expression is (13.19) And at qt \u0001 a \u0001 0°, the magnitude is Am sin(\u0003v), which, by a trigono- metric identity, is \u0003Am sin v. If the waveform crosses the horizontal axis with a positive-going slope 90° (p/2) sooner, as shown in Fig. 13.25, it is called a cosine wave; that is, sin(qt \u0005 90°) \u0001 sin\u0002 qt \u0005 \u0002 p 2 \u0002\u0003 \u0001 cos qt (13.20) Am sin(qt \u0003 v) Am sin(qt \u0005 v) Am sin(qt \u0006 v) 180°\u0002 p rad 20 ms\u0002 12 T \u0002 12 20 ms\u0002 4 T \u0002 4 20 ms\u0002 2 T \u0002 2 2p\u0002 314 2p \u0002 q FIG. 13.22 Example 13.10, horizontal axis in milliseconds. \u0004 ( – ) Am (2 – ) \u0003 Am sin\u0004 \u0002\u0004 \u0002 \u0004 FIG. 13.23 Deﬁning the phase shift for a sinusoidal function that crosses the horizontal axis with a positive slope before 0°. v (p + v) Am (2p + v) \u0003– Am sin v FIG. 13.24 Deﬁning the phase shift for a sinusoidal function that crosses the horizontal axis with a positive slope after 0°. 0 Am 90° cos \u0003 sin \u0003 p 2p \u0003 p 2 – p 2 p3 2 FIG. 13.25 Phase relationship between a sine wave and a cosine wave. 536  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS or sin qt \u0001 cos(qt \u0003 90°) \u0001 cos\u0002qt \u0003 \u0002 p 2 \u0002\u0003 (13.21) The terms lead and lag are used to indicate the relationship between two sinusoidal waveforms of the same frequency plotted on the same set of axes. In Fig. 13.25, the cosine curve is said to lead the sine curve by 90°, and the sine curve is said to lag the cosine curve by 90°. The 90° is referred to as the phase angle between the two waveforms. In language commonly applied, the waveforms are out of phase by 90°. Note that the phase angle between the two waveforms is measured between those two points on the horizontal axis through which each passes with the same slope. If both wave- forms cross the axis at the same point with the same slope, they are in phase. The geometric relationship between various forms of the sine and cosine functions can be derived from Fig. 13.26. For instance, starting at the sin a position, we ﬁnd that cos a is an additional 90° in the coun- terclockwise direction. Therefore, cos a \u0001 sin(a \u0005 90°). For \u0003sin a we must travel 180° in the counterclockwise (or clockwise) direction so that \u0003sin a \u0001 sin(a \u0006 180°), and so on, as listed below: (13.22) In addition, one should be aware that (13.23) If a sinusoidal expression should appear as e \u0001\u0003Em sin qt the negative sign is associated with the sine portion of the expression, not the peak value Em. In other words, the expression, if not for conve- nience, would be written e \u0001 Em(\u0003sin qt) Since \u0003sin qt \u0001 sin(qt \u0006 180°) the expression can also be written e \u0001 Em sin(qt \u0006 180°) revealing that a negative sign can be replaced by a 180° change in phase angle (\u0005 or \u0003); that is, e \u0001 Em sin qt \u0001 Em sin(qt \u0005 180°) \u0001 Em sin(qt \u0003 180°) A plot of each will clearly show their equivalence.

Phase Measurements The hookup procedure for using an oscilloscope to measure phase angles is covered in detail in Section 15.13. However, the equation for determining the phase angle can be introduced using Fig. 13.32. First, note that each sinusoidal function has the same frequency, permitting the use of either waveform to determine the period. For the waveform chosen in Fig. 13.32, the period encompasses 5 divisions at 0.2 ms/div. The phase shift between the waveforms (irrespective of which is lead- ing or lagging) is 2 divisions. Since the full period represents a cycle of 360°, the following ratio [from which Equation (13.24) can be derived] can be formed: \u0001 and v \u0001\u0004 360° (13.24) Substituting into Eq. (13.24) will result in v \u0001\u0004 360° \u0001 144° and e leads i by 144°. 13.6 AVERAGE VALUE Even though the concept of the average value is an important one in most technical ﬁelds, its true meaning is often misunderstood. In Fig. 13.33(a), for example, the average height of the sand may be required to determine the volume of sand available. The average height of the sand is that height obtained if the distance from one end to the other is maintained while the sand is leveled off, as shown in Fig. 13.33(b). The area under the mound of Fig. 13.33(a) will then equal the area under the rectangular shape of Fig. 13.33(b) as determined by A \u0001 b \u0004 h. Of course, the depth (into the page) of the sand must be the same for Fig. 13.33(a) and (b) for the preceding conclusions to have any meaning. In Fig. 13.33 the distance was measured from one end to the other. In Fig. 13.34(a) the distance extends beyond the end of the original pile of Fig. 13.33. The situation could be one where a landscaper would like to know the average height of the sand if spread out over a distance such as deﬁned in Fig. 13.34(a). The result of an increased distance is as shown in Fig. 13.34(b). The average height has decreased compared to Fig. 13.33. Quite obviously, therefore, the longer the distance, the lower is the average value.

For a sinusoidal waveform, the depression would have the same shape as the mound of sand (over one full cycle), resulting in an average value at ground level (or zero volts for a sinusoidal voltage over one full period). After traveling a considerable distance by car, some drivers like to calculate their average speed for the entire trip. This is usually done by dividing the miles traveled by the hours required to drive that distance. For example, if a person traveled 225 mi in 5 h, the average speed was 225 mi/5 h, or 45 mi/h. This same distance may have been traveled at various speeds for various intervals of time, as shown in Fig. 13.36. By ﬁnding the total area under the curve for the 5 h and then divid- ing the area by 5 h (the total time for the trip), we obtain the same result of 45 mi/h; that is, Average speed \u0001 (13.25) Average speed \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 mi/h \u0001 45 mi/h Equation (13.25) can be extended to include any variable quantity, such as current or voltage, if we let G denote the average value, as follows: G (average value) \u0001 (13.26) algebraic sum of areas\u0002\u0002\u0002 length of curve 225\u0002 5 (60 mi/h)(2 h) \u0005 (50 mi/h)(2.5 h)\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 5 h A1 \u0005 A2\u0002 5 h area under curve\u0002\u0002 length of curve Height Distance Sand (a) Height Average height Sand Same distance (b) FIG. 13.34 Effect of distance (length) on average value.

The algebraic sum of the areas must be determined, since some area contributions will be from below the horizontal axis. Areas above the axis will be assigned a positive sign, and those below, a negative sign. A positive average value will then be above the axis, and a negative value, below. The average value of any current or voltage is the value indicated on a dc meter. In other words, over a complete cycle, the average value is AVERAGE VALUE  541 the equivalent dc value. In the analysis of electronic circuits to be con- sidered in a later course, both dc and ac sources of voltage will be applied to the same network. It will then be necessary to know or deter- mine the dc (or average value) and ac components of the voltage or cur- rent in various parts of the system.

We found the areas under the curves in the preceding example by using a simple geometric formula. If we should encounter a sine wave or any other unusual shape, however, we must ﬁnd the area by some other means. We can obtain a good approximation of the area by attempting to reproduce the original wave shape using a number of small rectangles or other familiar shapes, the area of which we already know through simple geometric formulas. For example, the area of the positive (or negative) pulse of a sine wave is 2Am. Approximating this waveform by two triangles (Fig. 13.43), we obtain (using area \u0001 1/2 base \u0004 height for the area of a triangle) a rough idea of the actual area: bh Area shaded \u0001 2\u0002 bh\u0003 \u0001 2\u0004\u0002 \u0003\u0002 \u0003(Am)\u0005 \u0001 Am \u0001 1.58Am A closer approximation might be a rectangle with two similar trian- gles (Fig. 13.44): Area \u0001 Am \u0005 2\u0002 bh\u0003 \u0001 Am \u0005 Am\u0001 pAm \u0001 2.094Am which is certainly close to the actual area. If an inﬁnite number of forms were used, an exact answer of 2Am could be obtained. For irreg- ular waveforms, this method can be especially useful if data such as the average value are desired.

Solution: From the appearance of the waveform, the average value is positive and in the vicinity of 2 mV. Occasionally, judgments of this type will have to be made. Instrumentation The dc level or average value of any waveform can be found using a digital multimeter (DMM) or an oscilloscope. For purely dc circuits, simply set the DMM on dc, and read the voltage or current levels. Oscilloscopes are limited to voltage levels using the sequence of steps listed below: 1. First choose GND from the DC-GND-AC option list associated with each vertical channel. The GND option blocks any signal to which the oscilloscope probe may be connected from entering the oscilloscope and responds with just a horizontal line. Set the resulting line in the middle of the vertical axis on the horizontal axis, as shown in Fig. 13.50(a). 2(10 V)\u0002 2p 2Am \u0005 0\u0002 2p v (mV) 10 mV 0 t FIG. 13.49 Example 13.18.

Apply the oscilloscope probe to the voltage to be measured (if not already connected), and switch to the DC option. If a dc volt- age is present, the horizontal line will shift up or down, as demonstrated in Fig. 13.50(b). Multiplying the shift by the verti- cal sensitivity will result in the dc voltage. An upward shift is a positive voltage (higher potential at the red or positive lead of the oscilloscope), while a downward shift is a negative voltage (lower potential at the red or positive lead of the oscilloscope). \u00031 1 cycle 2pp v (V) 10 0 Sine wave FIG. 13.48 Example 13.17.

The procedure outlined above can be applied to any alternating waveform such as the one in Fig. 13.49. In some cases the average value may require moving the starting position of the waveform under the AC option to a different region of the screen or choosing a higher voltage scale. DMMs can read the average or dc level of any waveform by simply choosing the appropriate scale. (13.29)Vdc \u0001 (vertical shift in div.) \u0004 (vertical sensitivity in V/div.) For the waveform of Fig. 13.50(b), Vdc \u0001 (2.5 div.)(50 mV/div.) \u0001 125 mV The oscilloscope can also be used to measure the dc or average level of any waveform using the following sequence: 1. Using the GND option, reset the horizontal line to the middle of the screen. 2. Switch to AC (all dc components of the signal to which the probe is connected will be blocked from entering the oscilloscope— only the alternating, or changing, components will be displayed). Note the location of some deﬁnitive point on the waveform, such as the bottom of the half-wave rectiﬁed waveform of Fig. 13.51(a); that is, note its position on the vertical scale. For the future, whenever you use the AC option, keep in mind that the computer will distribute the waveform above and below the hori- zontal axis such that the average value is zero; that is, the area above the axis will equal the area below. 3. Then switch to DC (to permit both the dc and the ac components of the waveform to enter the oscilloscope), and note the shift in the chosen level of part 2, as shown in Fig. 13.51(b). Equation (13.29) can then be used to determine the dc or average value of the waveform. For the waveform of Fig. 13.51(b), the average value is about Vav \u0001 Vdc \u0001 (0.9 div.)(5 V/div.) \u0001 4.5 V 546  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS 13.7 EFFECTIVE (rms) VALUES This section will begin to relate dc and ac quantities with respect to the power delivered to a load. It will help us determine the amplitude of a sinusoidal ac current required to deliver the same power as a particular dc current. The question frequently arises, How is it possi- ble for a sinusoidal ac quantity to deliver a net power if, over a full cycle, the net current in any one direction is zero (average value \u0001 0)? It would almost appear that the power delivered during the posi- tive portion of the sinusoidal waveform is withdrawn during the neg- ative portion, and since the two are equal in magnitude, the net power delivered is zero. However, understand that irrespective of direction, current of any magnitude through a resistor will deliver power to that resistor. In other words, during the positive or negative portions of a sinusoidal ac current, power is being delivered at each instant of time to the resistor. The power delivered at each instant will, of course, vary with the magnitude of the sinusoidal ac current, but there will be a net ﬂow during either the positive or the negative pulses with a net ﬂow over the full cycle. The net power ﬂow will equal twice that delivered by either the positive or the negative regions of sinusoidal quantity. A ﬁxed relationship between ac and dc voltages and currents can be derived from the experimental setup shown in Fig. 13.52. A resistor in a water bath is connected by switches to a dc and an ac supply. If switch 1 is closed, a dc current I, determined by the resistance R and battery voltage E, will be established through the resistor R. The temperature reached by the water is determined by the dc power dissipated in the form of heat by the resistor. Switch 2 iac ac generatore Switch 1 dc source E R Idc FIG. 13.52 An experimental setup to establish a relationship between dc and ac quantities. If switch 2 is closed and switch 1 left open, the ac current through the resistor will have a peak value of Im. The temperature reached by the water is now determined by the ac power dissipated in the form of heat by the resistor. The ac input is varied until the temperature is the same as that reached with the dc input. When this is accomplished, the average electrical power delivered to the resistor R by the ac source is the same as that delivered by the dc source. The power delivered by the ac supply at any instant of time is Pac \u0001 (iac) 2R \u0001 (Im sin qt) 2R \u0001 (I 2 m sin 2qt)R but sin 2 qt \u0001 (1 \u0003 cos 2qt) (trigonometric identity) 1 \u0002 2 EFFECTIVE (rms) VALUES  547 Therefore, Pac \u0001 I 2 m\u0004 (1 \u0003 cos 2qt)\u0005R and (13.30) The average power delivered by the ac source is just the ﬁrst term, since the average value of a cosine wave is zero even though the wave may have twice the frequency of the original input current waveform.

The equivalent dc value is called the effective value of the sinusoidal quantity. In summary, (13.31) or (13.32) and (13.33) or (13.34) As a simple numerical example, it would require an ac current with a peak value of \u00072\b(10) \u0001 14.14 A to deliver the same power to the resistor in Fig. 13.52 as a dc current of 10 A. The effective value of any quantity plotted as a function of time can be found by using the fol- lowing equation derived from the experiment just described: Ieff \u0001 \t (13.35) or Ieff \u0001 \t (13.36) area (i 2(t))\u0002\u0002 T \u0006 T 0 i 2(t) dt \u0002 T Em \u0001 \u00072\bEeff \u0001 1.414Eeff Eeff \u0001 0.707Em Im \u0001 \u00072\bIeff \u0001 1.414Ieff Ieq(dc) \u0001 Ieff \u0001 0.707Im Im\u0002 \u00072\b I 2 m R \u0002 2 Pac \u0001 \u0002 I 2 m 2 R \u0002 \u0003 \u0002 I 2 m 2 R \u0002 cos 2qt 1 \u0002 2 548  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS which, in words, states that to ﬁnd the effective value, the function i(t) must ﬁrst be squared. After i(t) is squared, the area under the curve is found by integration. It is then divided by T, the length of the cycle or the period of the waveform, to obtain the average or mean value of the squared waveform. The ﬁnal step is to take the square root of the mean value. This procedure gives us another designation for the effective value, the root-mean-square (rms) value. In fact, since the rms term is the most commonly used in the educational and industrial communities, it will used throughout this text.

It might prove interesting to compare the rms and average values of these waveforms. The rms values of sinusoidal quantities such as voltage or current will be represented by E and I. These symbols are the same as those used for dc voltages and currents. To avoid confusion, the peak value of a waveform will always have a subscript m associated with it: Im sin qt. Caution: When ﬁnding the rms value of the positive pulse of a sine wave, note that the squared area is not simply (2Am) 2 \u0001 4A 2 m;it must be found by a completely new integration. This will always be the case for any waveform that is not rectangular. A unique situation arises if a waveform has both a dc and an ac com- ponent that may be due to a source such as the one in Fig. 13.61. The combination appears frequently in the analysis of electronic networks where both dc and ac levels are present in the same system. 32,000 \u0004 10 \u00033 \u0002\u0002 20 \u0004 10 \u00033 (1600)(10 \u0004 10 \u00033) \u0005 (1600)(10 \u0004 10 \u00033)\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 20 \u0004 10 \u00033 20100 v2 (V) 1600 t (ms) FIG. 13.60 The squared waveform of Fig. 13.59. 3 sin t + – 6 V vT + – vT 7.5 V 6 V 4.5 V 0 t ω FIG. 13.61 Generation and display of a waveform having a dc and an ac component.

The development of Eq. (13.37) can be found in Chapter 25. Instrumentation It is important to note whether the DMM in use is a true rms meter or simply a meter where the average value is calibrated (as described in the next section) to indicate the rms level. A true rms meter will read the effective value of any waveform (such as Figs. 13.49 and 13.61) and is not limited to only sinusoidal waveforms. Since the label true rms is normally not placed on the face of the meter, it is prudent to check the manual if waveforms other than purely sinusoidal are to be encountered. For any type of rms meter, be sure to check the manual for its frequency range of application. For most it is less than 1 kHz. 13.8 ac METERS AND INSTRUMENTS The d’Arsonval movement employed in dc meters can also be used to measure sinusoidal voltages and currents if the bridge rectiﬁer of Fig. 13.62 is placed between the signal to be measured and the average read- ing movement. The bridge rectiﬁer, composed of four diodes (electronic switches), will convert the input signal of zero average value to one having an average value sensitive to the peak value of the input signal. The con- version process is well described in most basic electronics texts. Fun- damentally, conduction is permitted through the diodes in such a man- ner as to convert the sinusoidal input of Fig. 13.63(a) to one having the appearance of Fig. 13.63(b). The negative portion of the input has been effectively “ﬂipped over” by the bridge conﬁguration. The resulting waveform of Fig. 13.63(b) is called a full-wave rectiﬁed waveform. vmovement vi + – +– FIG. 13.62 Full-wave bridge rectiﬁer. vi Vm –Vm 0 \u0002 2 \u0003 (a) vmovement Vm 0 \u0002 2 \u0003 (b) Vdc = 0.637Vm \u0002\u0002 FIG. 13.63 (a) Sinusoidal input; (b) full-wave rectiﬁed signal.

The result is half-wave (13.39) A second movement, called the electrodynamometer movement (Fig. 13.65), can measure both ac and dc quantities without a change in internal circuitry. The movement can, in fact, read the effective value of any periodic or nonperiodic waveform because a reversal in current direction reverses the ﬁelds of both the stationary and the movable coils, so the deﬂection of the pointer is always up-scale. The VOM, introduced in Chapter 2, can be used to measure both dc and ac voltages using a d’Arsonval movement and the proper switching networks. That is, when the meter is used for dc measurements, the dial setting will establish the proper series resistance for the chosen scale and will permit the appropriate dc level to pass directly to the move- ment. For ac measurements, the dial setting will introduce a network that employs a full- or half-wave rectiﬁer to establish a dc level. As dis- cussed above, each setting is properly calibrated to indicate the desired quantity on the face of the instrument.

In fact, for the DMM of Fig. 2.27, the same scale factor of Eq. (13.38) is employed; that is, the average value is scaled up by a factor of 1.11 to obtain the rms value. In digital meters, however, there are no moving parts such as in the d’Arsonval or electrodynamometer movements to display the signal level. Rather, the average value is sensed by a multiprocessor integrated circuit (IC), which in turn determines which digits should appear on the digital display. Digital meters can also be used to measure nonsinusoidal signals, but the scale factor of each input waveform must ﬁrst be known (nor- mally provided by the manufacturer in the operator’s manual). For instance, the scale factor for an average responding DMM on the ac rms scale will produce an indication for a square-wave input that is 1.11 times the peak value. For a triangular input, the response is 0.555 times the peak value. Obviously, for a sine wave input, the response is 0.707 times the peak value. For any instrument, it is always good practice to read (if only brieﬂy) the operator’s manual if it appears that you will use the instrument on a regular basis. For frequency measurements, the frequency counter of Fig. 13.67 provides a digital readout of sine, square, and triangular waves from 5 Hz to 100 MHz at input levels from 30 mV to 42 V. Note the relative simplicity of the panel and the high degree of accuracy available. The Amp-Clamp® of Fig. 13.68 is an instrument that can measure alternating current in the ampere range without having to open the cir- cuit. The loop is opened by squeezing the “trigger”; then it is placed around the current-carrying conductor. Through transformer action, the level of current in rms units will appear on the appropriate scale. The accuracy of this instrument is \u00063% of full scale at 60 Hz, and its scales have maximum values ranging from 6 A to 300 A. The addition of two leads, as indicated in the ﬁgure, permits its use as both a voltmeter and an ohmmeter. One of the most versatile and important instruments in the electron- ics industry is the oscilloscope, which has already been introduced in this chapter. It provides a display of the waveform on a cathode-ray tube to permit the detection of irregularities and the determination of quantities such as magnitude, frequency, period, dc component, and so on. The analog oscilloscope of Fig. 13.69 can display two waveforms at the same time (dual-channel) using an innovative interface (front panel). It employs menu buttons to set the vertical and horizontal scales by choosing from selections appearing on the screen. One can also store up to four measurement setups for future use.

(Courtesy of Tektronix, Inc.) 554  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS A student accustomed to watching TV might be confused when ﬁrst introduced to an oscilloscope. There is, at least initially, an assumption that the oscilloscope is generating the waveform on the screen—much like a TV broadcast. However, it is important to clearly understand that an oscilloscope displays only those signals generated elsewhere and connected to the input terminals of the oscilloscope. The absence of an external signal will simply result in a horizontal line on the screen of the scope. On most modern-day oscilloscopes, there is a switch or knob with the choice DC/GND/AC, as shown in Fig. 13.70(a), that is often ignored or treated too lightly in the early stages of scope utilization. The effect of each position is fundamentally as shown in Fig. 13.70(b). In the DC mode the dc and ac components of the input signal can pass directly to the display. In the AC position the dc input is blocked by the capacitor, but the ac portion of the signal can pass through to the screen. In the GND position the input signal is prevented from reaching the scope display by a direct ground connection, which reduces the scope display to a single horizontal line. Input signal AC GND DC (b) Oscilloscope display AC GND DC (a) FIG. 13.70 AC-GND-DC switch for the vertical channel of an oscilloscope. 13.9 APPLICATIONS (120 V at 60 Hz) versus (220 V at 50 Hz) In North and South America the most common available ac supply is 120 V at 60 Hz, while in Europe and the Eastern countries it is 220 V at 50 Hz. The choices of rms value and frequency were obviously made carefully because they have such an important impact on the design and operation of so many systems. The fact that the frequency difference is only 10 Hz reveals that there was agreement on the general frequency range that should be used for power generation and distribution. History suggests that the ques- tion of frequency selection was originally focused on that frequency that would not exhibit ﬂicker in the incandescent lamps available in those days. Technically, however, there really wouldn’t be a noticeable difference between 50 and 60 cycles per second based on this criterion. Another important factor in the early design stages was the effect of fre- quency on the size of transformers, which play a major role in power generation and distribution. Working through the fundamental equa- tions for transformer design, you will ﬁnd that the size of a transformer is inversely proportional to frequency. The result is that transformers operating at 50 Hz must be larger (on a purely mathematical basis about 17% larger) than those operating at 60 Hz. You will therefore ﬁnd that transformers designed for the international market where they can oper- APPLICATIONS  555 ate on 50 Hz or 60 Hz are designed around the 50-Hz frequency. On the other side of the coin, however, higher frequencies result in increased concerns about arcing, increased losses in the transformer core due to eddy current and hysteresis losses (Chapter 19), and skin effect phe- nomena (Chapter 19). Somewhere in the discussion we must consider the fact that 60 Hz is an exact multiple of 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Since accurate timing is such a critical part of our technological design, was this a signiﬁcant motive in the ﬁnal choice? There is also the question about whether the 50 Hz is a result of the close afﬁnity of this value to the metric system. Keep in mind that powers of 10 are all powerful in the metric system, with 100 cm in a meter, 100°C the boiling point of water, and so on. Note that 50 Hz is exactly half of this special number. All in all, it would seem that both sides have an argument that would be worth defending. However, in the ﬁnal analysis, we must also wonder whether the difference is simply political in nature. The difference in voltage between North America and Europe is a different matter entirely in the sense that the difference is close to 100%. Again, however, there are valid arguments for both sides. There is no question that larger voltages such as 220 V raise safety issues beyond those raised by voltages of 120 V. However, when higher volt- ages are supplied, there is less current in the wire for the same power demand, permitting the use of smaller conductors—a real money saver. In addition, motors, compressors, and so on, found in common home appliances and throughout the industrial community can be smaller in size. Higher voltages, however, also bring back the concern about arc- ing effects, insulation requirements, and, due to real safety concerns, higher installation costs. In general, however, international travelers are prepared for most situations if they have a transformer that can convert from their home level to that of the country they plan to visit. Most equipment (not clocks, of course) can run quite well on 50 Hz or 60 Hz for most travel periods. For any unit not operating at its design fre- quency, it will simply have to “work a little harder” to perform the given task. The major problem for the traveler is not the transformer itself but the wide variety of plugs used from one country to another. Each country has its own design for the “female” plug in the wall. For the three-week tour, this could mean as many as 6 to 10 different plugs of the type shown in Fig. 13.71. For a 120-V, 60-Hz supply, the plug is quite standard in appearance with its two spade leads (and possible ground connection). In any event, both the 120 V at 60 Hz and the 220 V at 50 Hz are obviously meeting the needs of the consumer. It is a debate that could go on at length without an ultimate victor. Safety Concerns (High Voltages and dc versus ac) Be aware that any “live” network should be treated with a calculated level of respect. Electricity in its various forms is not to be feared but should be employed with some awareness of its potentially dangerous side effects. It is common knowledge that electricity and water do not mix (never use extension cords or plug in TVs or radios in the bath- room) because a full 120 V in a layer of water of any height (from a shallow puddle to a full bath) can be lethal. However, other effects of dc and ac voltages are less known. In general, as the voltage and cur- rent increase, your concern about safety should increase exponentially. FIG. 13.71 Variety of plugs for a 220-V, 50-Hz connection. 556  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS For instance, under dry conditions, most human beings can survive a 120-V ac shock such as obtained when changing a light bulb, turning on a switch, and so on. Most electricians have experienced such a jolt many times in their careers. However, ask an electrician to relate how it feels to hit 220 V, and the response (if he or she has been unfortunate to have had such an experience) will be totally different. How often have you heard of a back-hoe operator hitting a 220-V line and having a fatal heart attack? Remember, the operator is sitting in a metal container on a damp ground which provides an excellent path for the resulting cur- rent to ﬂow from the line to ground. If only for a short period of time, with the best environment (rubber-sole shoes, etc.), in a situation where you can quickly escape the situation, most human beings can also sur- vive a 220-V shock. However, as mentioned above, it is one you will not quickly forget. For voltages beyond 220 V rms, the chances of sur- vival go down exponentially with increase in voltage. It takes only about 10 mA of steady current through the heart to put it in deﬁbrilla- tion. In general, therefore, always be sure that the power is discon- nected when working on the repair of electrical equipment. Don’t assume that throwing a wall switch will disconnect the power. Throw the main circuit breaker and test the lines with a voltmeter before work- ing on the system. Since voltage is a two-point phenomenon, don’t be a hero and work with one line at at time—accidents happen! You should also be aware that the reaction to dc voltages is quite dif- ferent from that to ac voltages. You have probably seen in movies or comic strips that people are often unable to let go of a hot wire. This is evidence of the most important difference between the two types of voltages. As mentioned above, if you happen to touch a “hot” 120-V ac line, you will probably get a good sting, but you can let go. If it hap- pens to be a “hot” 120-V dc line, you will probably not be able to let go, and a fatality could occur. Time plays an important role when this happens, because the longer you are subjected to the dc voltage, the more the resistance in the body decreases until a fatal current can be established. The reason that we can let go of an ac line is best demon- strated by carefully examining the 120-V rms, 60-Hz voltage in Fig. 13.72. Since the voltage is oscillating, there is a period of time when the voltage is near zero or less than, say, 20 V, and is reversing in direction. Although this time interval is very short, it appears every 8.3 ms and provides a window to let go. Now that we are aware of the additional dangers of dc voltages, it is important to mention that under the wrong conditions, dc voltages as low as 12 V such as from a car battery can be quite dangerous. If you happen to be working on a car under wet conditions, or if you are sweating badly for some reason or, worse yet, wearing a wedding ring that may have moisture and body salt underneath, touching the positive terminal may initiate the process whereby the body resistance begins to drop and serious injury could take place. It is one of the reasons you seldom see a professional electrician wearing any rings or jewelry—it is just not worth the risk. Before leaving this topic of safety concerns, you should also be aware of the dangers of high-frequency supplies. We are all aware of what 2.45 GHz at 120 V can do to a meat product in a microwave oven. As discussed in Chapter 5, it is therefore very important that the seal around the oven be as tight as possible. However, don’t ever assume that anything is absolutely perfect in design—so don’t make it a habit to view the cooking process in the microwave 6 in. from the door on a V(volts) tf 120 V rms ac voltage t 170 20 0 –20 FIG 13.72 Interval of time when sinusoidal voltage is near zero volts. APPLICATIONS  557 continuing basis. Find something else to do, and check the food only when the cooking process is complete. If you ever visit the Empire State Building, you will notice that you are unable to get close to the antenna on the dome due to the high-frequency signals being emitted with a great deal of power. Also note the large KEEP OUT signs near radio transmission towers for local radio stations. Standing within 10 ft of an AM transmitter working at 540 kHz would bring on disaster. Sim- ply holding (not to be tried!) a ﬂuorescent bulb near the tower could make it light up due to the excitation of the molecules inside the bulb. In total, therefore, treat any situation with high ac voltages or cur- rents, high-energy dc levels, and high frequencies with added care. Bulb Savers Ever since the invention of the light bulb, consumers have clamored for ways to extend the life of a bulb. I can remember the days when I was taught to always turn a light off when leaving a room and not to play with a light switch because it cost us a penny (at a time when a penny had some real value) every time I turned the switch on and off. Through advanced design we now have bulbs that are guaranteed to last a num- ber of years. They cost more, but there is no need to replace the bulb as often, and over time there is a ﬁnancial savings. For some of us it is simply a matter of having to pay so much for a single bulb. For interest sake, I measured the cold dc resistance of a standard 60-W bulb and found it to be about 14 \u0007. Forgetting any inductive effects due to the ﬁlament and wire, this would mean a current of 120 V/14 \u0007\u0001 8.6 A when the light is ﬁrst turned on. This is a fairly heavy current for the ﬁlament to absorb when you consider that the nor- mal operating current is 60 W/120 V \u0001 0.5 A. Fortunately, it lasts for only a few milliseconds, as shown in Fig. 13.73(a), before the bulb heats up, causing the ﬁlament resistance to quickly increase and cut the current down to reasonable levels. However, over time, hitting the bulb with 8.6 A every time you turn the switch on will take its toll on the ﬁl- ament, and eventually the ﬁlament will simply surrender its natural characteristics and open up. You can easily tell if a bulb is bad by sim- ply shaking it and listening for the clinking sound of the broken ﬁla- ment hitting the bulb. Assuming an initial current of 8.6 A for a single bulb, if the light switch controlled four 60-W bulbs in the same room, the surge current through the switch could be as high as 4(8.6 A) \u0001 34.4 A as shown in Fig. 13.73(b), which probably exceeds the rating of the breaker (typically 20 A) for the circuit. However, the saving grace is that it lasts for only a few milliseconds, and circuit breakers are not designed to react that quickly. Even the GFI safety breakers in the bath- room are typically rated at a 5-ms response time. However, when you look at the big picture and imagine all these spikes on the line gener- ated throughout a residential community, it is certainly a problem that the power company has to deal with on a continuing basis. One way to suppress this surge current is to place an inductor in series with the bulb to choke out the spikes down the line. This method, in fact, leads to one way of extending the life of a light bulb through the use of dimmers. Any well-designed dimmer (such as the one described in Chapter 12) has an inductor in the line to suppress current surges. The results are both an extended life for the bulb and the ability to con- trol the power level. Left on in the full voltage position, the switch could be used as a regular switch and the life of the bulb could be 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 t (s) 2 34.4 IT (A), four parallel 60-W bulbs (b) 250 ms (a) Ibulb (A) 8.6 0.5 01 2 3 4 56 7 t (ms) FIG 13.73 Surge currents: (a) single 60-W bulb; (b) four parallel 60-W bulbs. 558  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS extended. In fact, many dimmers now use triacs designed to turn on only when the applied voltage passes through zero. If we look at the full sine wave of Fig. 13.74(a), we ﬁnd that the voltage is at least half of its maximum value of 85 V for a full two-thirds of each cycle, or about 67% of the time. The chances, therefore, of your turning on a light bulb with at least 85 V on the line is far better than 2 to 1, so you can expect the current for a 60-W light bulb to be at least 85 V/14 \u0007 \u0001 6 A 67% of the time, which exceeds the rated 0.5-A rated value by 1100%.

Another commercial offering to extend the life of light bulbs is the smaller circular disc shown in Fig. 13.75(a) which is inserted between the bulb and the holder. Contacts are provided on both sides to permit conduction through the simple diode network shown in Fig. 13.75(b). You may recall from an earlier chapter that the voltage across diodes in the on state is 0.7 V as shown for each diode in Fig. 13.75(b) for the positive portion of the input voltage. The result is that the voltage to the bulb is reduced by about 1.4 V throughout the cycle, reducing the power delivered to the bulb. For most situations the reduced lighting is not a problem, and the bulb will last longer simply because it is not pressed to work at full output. However, the real saving in the device is the manner in which it could help suppress the surge currents through the light bulb. The true characteristics of a diode are shown in Fig. 13.75(c) for the full range of currents through the diode. For most applications in electronic circuits, the vertical region is employed. For excessive currents the diode characteristics ﬂatten out as shown. This region is characterized as having a large resistance (compared to very small resistance of the vertical region) which will come into play when the bulb is ﬁrst turned on. In other words, when the bulb is ﬁrst turned on, the current will be so high that the diode will enter its high- resistance region and by Ohm’s law will limit the surge current— thereby extending the life of the bulb. The two diodes facing the other way are for the negative portion of the supply voltage. New methods of extending the life of bulbs hit the marketplace every day. All in all, however, one guaranteed way to extend the life of your bulbs is to return to the old philosophy of turning lights off when you leave a room, and “Don’t play with the light switch!” 13.10 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice OrCAD Capture offers a variety of ac voltage and current sources. However, for the purposes of this text, the voltage source VSIN and the current source ISIN are the most appropriate because they have a list of attributes that will cover current areas of interest. Under the library SOURCE, a number of others are listed, but they don’t have the full range of the above, or they are dedicated to only one type of analysis. On occasion, ISRC will be used because it has an arrow symbol like that appearing in the text, and it can be used for dc, ac, and some transient analyses. The symbol for ISIN is simply a sine wave which utilizes the plus-and-minus sign to indicate direction. The sources VAC, IAC, VSRC, and ISRC are ﬁne if the magnitude and the phase of a speciﬁc quantity are desired or if a transient plot against frequency is desired. However, they will not provide a transient response against time even if the frequency and the transient informa- tion are provided for the simulation. For all of the sinusoidal sources, the magnitude (VAMPL) is the peak value of the waveform and not the rms value. This will become clear when a plot of a quantity is desired and the magnitude calculated by PSpice is the peak value of the transient response. However, for a purely steady-state ac response, the magnitude provided can be the rms 560  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS value, and the output read as the rms value. Only when a plot is desired will it be clear that PSpice is accepting every ac magnitude as the peak value of the waveform. Of course, the phase angle is the same whether the magnitude is the peak or the rms value. Before examining the mechanics of getting the various sources, remember that Transient Analysis provides an ac or a dc output versus time, while AC Sweep is used to obtain a plot versus frequency. To obtain any of the sources listed above, apply the following sequence: Place part key-Place Part dialog box-Source-(enter type of source). Once selected the ac source VSIN will appear on the schematic with VOFF, VAMPL, and FREQ. Always specify VOFF as 0 V (unless a speciﬁc value is part of the analysis), and provide a value for the ampli- tude and frequency. The remaining quantities of PHASE, AC, DC, DF, and TD can be entered by double-clicking on the source symbol to obtain the Property Editor, although PHASE, DF (damping factor), and TD (time delay) do have a default of 0 s. To add a phase angle, sim- ply click on PHASE, enter the phase angle in the box below, and then select Apply. If you want to display a factor such as a phase angle of 60°, simply click on PHASE followed by Display to obtain the Dis- play Properties dialog box. Then choose Name and Value followed by OK and Apply, and leave the Properties Editor dialog box (X) to see PHASE\u000260 next to the VSIN source. The next chapter will include the use of the ac source in a simple circuit. Electronics Workbench For EWB, the ac voltage source is available from two sources—the Sources parts bin and the Function Generator. The major difference between the two is that the phase angle can be set when using the Sources parts bin, whereas it cannot be set using the Function Generator. Under Sources, the ac voltage source is the fourth option down on the left column of the toolbar. When selected and placed, it will display the default values for the amplitude, frequency, and phase. All the param- eters of the source can be changed by double-clicking on the source symbol to obtain the AC Voltage dialog box. The Voltage Amplitude and Voltage RMS are interlinked so that when you change one, the other will change accordingly. For the 1V default value, the rms value is automatically listed as 0.71 (not 0.7071 because of the hundredths- place accuracy). Note that the unit of measurement is controlled by the scrolls to the right of the default label and cannot be set by typing in the desired unit of measurement. The label can be changed by simply switching the Label heading and inserting the desired label. After all the changes have been made in the AC Voltage dialog box, click OK, and all the changes will appear next to the ac voltage source symbol. In Fig. 13.76 the label was changed to Vs and the amplitude to 10 V while the frequency and phase angle were left with their default values. It is particularly important to realize that for any frequency analysis (that is, where the frequency will change), the AC Magnitude of the ac source must be set under Analysis Setup in the AC Voltage dialog box. Failure to do so will create results linked to the default values rather than the value set under the Value heading. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  561 To view the sinusoidal voltage set in Fig. 13.76, an oscilloscope can be selected from the Instrument toolbar at the right of the screen. It is the fourth option down and has the appearance shown in Fig. 13.76 when selected. Note that it is a dual-channel oscilloscope with an A channel and a B channel. It has a ground (G) connection and a trigger (T) connection. The connections for viewing the ac voltage source on the A channel are provided in Fig. 13.76. Note that the trigger control is also connected to the A channel for sync control. The screen appear- ing in Fig. 13.76 can be displayed by double-clicking on the oscillo- scope symbol on the screen. It has all the major controls of a typical laboratory oscilloscope. When you select Simulate-Run or select 1 on the Simulate Switch, the ac voltage will appear on the screen. Chang- ing the Time base to 100 ms/div. will result in the display of Fig. 13.76 since there are 10 divisions across the screen and 10(100ms) \u0001 1 ms (the period of the applied signal). Changes in the Time base are made by simply clicking on the default value to obtain the scrolls in the same box. It is important to remember, however, that changes in the oscilloscope setting or any network should not be made until the simulation is ended by disabling the Simulate-Run option or placing the Simulate switch in the 0 mode. The options within the time base are set by the scroll bars and can- not be changed—again they match those typically available on a labo- ratory oscilloscope. The vertical sensitivity of the A channel was auto- matically set by the program at 5 V/div. to result in two vertical boxes for the peak value as shown in Fig. 13.76. Note the AC and DC key pads below Channel A. Since there is no dc component in the applied signal, either one will result in the same display. The Trigger control is FIG. 13.76 Using the oscilloscope to display the sinusoidal ac voltage source available in the Electronics Workbench Sources tool bin. 562  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS set on the positive transition at a level of 0 V. The T1 and T2 refer to the cursor positions on the horizontal time axis. By simply clicking on the small red triangle at the top of the red line at the far left edge of the screen and dragging the triangle, you can move the vertical red line to any position along the axis. In Fig.13.76 it was moved to the peak value of the waveform at 1⁄4 of the total period or 0.25 ms \u0001 250 ms. Note the value of T1 (250.3 ms) and the corresponding value of VA1 (10.0V). By moving the other cursor with a blue triangle at the top to 1⁄2 the total period or 0.5 ms \u0001 500 ms, we ﬁnd that the value at T2 (500.3 ms) is \u000318.9 mV (VA2), which is approximately 0 V for a waveform with a peak value of 10 V. The accuracy is controlled by the number of data points called for in the simulation setup. The more data points, the higher the likelihood of a higher degree of accuracy for the desired quantity. However, an increased number of data points will also extend the running time of the simulation. The third display box to the right gives the difference between T2 and T1 as 250 ms and difference between their magnitudes (VA2-VA1) as \u000310 V, with the negative sign appearing because VA1 is greater than VA2. As mentioned above, an ac voltage can also be obtained from the Function Generator appearing as the second option down on the Instrument toolbar. Its symbol appears in Fig. 13.77 with positive, neg- ative, and ground connections. Double-click on the generator graphic symbol, and the Function Generator-XFG1 dialog box will appear in which selections can be made. For this example, the sinusoidal wave- form is chosen. The Frequency is set at 1 kHz, the Amplitude is set at 10 V, and the Offset is left at 0 V. Note that there is no option to set the phase angle as was possible for the source above. Double-clicking on the FIG. 13.77 Using the function generator to place a sinusoidal ac voltage waveform on the screen of the oscilloscope. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  563 oscilloscope will generate the oscilloscope on which a Timebase of 100 ms/div. can be set again with a vertical sensitivity of 5 V/div. Select 1 on the Simulate switch, and the waveform of Fig. 13.77 will appear. Choosing Singular under Trigger will result in a ﬁxed display; then set the Simulate switch on 0 to the end the simulation. Placing the cursors in the same position shows that the waveforms for Figs. 13.76 and 13.77 are the same. For most of the EWB analyses to appear in this text, the AC–VOLTAGE–SOURCE under Sources will be employed. How- ever, with such a limited introduction to EWB, it seemed appropriate to introduce the use of the Function Generator because of its close linkage to the laboratory experience. C\u0003\u0003 Calculating the Average Value of a Waveform The absence of any network conﬁgurations to analyze in this chapter severely limits the content with respect to packaged computer programs. However, the door is still wide open for the application of a language to write pro- grams that can be helpful in the application of some of the concepts introduced in the chapter. In particular, let us examine the C\u0005\u0005 pro- gram of Fig. 13.78, designed to calculate the average value of a pulse waveform having up to 5 different levels. The program begins with a heading and preprocessor directive. Recall that the iostream.h header ﬁle sets up the input-output path Heading Preprocessor directive Define form and name of variables Obtain # of levels Iterative for statement Calculate Vave Display results Body of program FIG. 13.78 C\u0005\u0005 program designed to calculate the average value of a waveform with up to ﬁve positive or negative pulses. 564  SINUSOIDAL ALTERNATING WAVEFORMS between the program and the disk operating system. Note that the main () part of the program extends all the way down to the bottom, as iden- tiﬁed by the braces { }. Within this region all the calculations will be performed, and the results will be displayed. Within the main () part of the program, all the variables to be employed in the calculations are deﬁned as ﬂoating point (decimal val- ues) or integer (whole numbers). The comments on the right identify each variable. This is followed by a display of the question about how many levels will be encountered in the waveform using cout (comment out). The cin (comment in) statement permits a response from the user. Next, the loop statement for is employed to establish a ﬁxed number of repetitions of the sequence appearing within the parentheses ( ) for a number of loops deﬁned by the variable levels. The format of this for statement is such that the ﬁrst entry within the parentheses ( ) is the initial value of the variable count (1 in this case), followed by a semi- colon and then a test expression determining how many times the sequence to follow will be repeated. In other words, if levels is 5, then the ﬁrst pass through the for statement will result in 1 being compared to 5, and the test expression will be satisﬁed because 5 is greater than or equal to 1 (< \u0001). On the next pass, count will be increased to 2, and the same test will be performed. Eventually count will equal 5, the test expression will not be satisﬁed, and the program will move to its next statement, which is Vave \u0001 VT sum/ T. The last entry count\u0005\u0005 of the for statement simply increments the variable count after each iteration. The ﬁrst line within the for statement calls for a line to be skipped, fol- lowed by a question on the display about the level of voltage for the ﬁrst time interval. The question will include the current state of the count variable followed by a colon. In C\u0005\u0005 all character outputs must be displayed in quotes (not required for numerical values). However, note the absence of the quotes for count since it will be a numerical value. Next the user enters the ﬁrst voltage level through cin, followed by a request for the time interval. In this case units are not provided but simply measured as an increment of the whole; that is, if the total period is 5 ms and the ﬁrst interval is 2 ms, then just a 2 is entered. The area under the pulse is then calculated to establish the variable VTsum, which was initially set at 0. On the next pass the value of VTsum will be the value obtained by the ﬁrst run plus the new area. In other words, VTsum is a storage for the total accumulated area. Simi- larly, T is the accumulated sum of the time intervals. Following a FALSE response from the test expression of the for statement, the program will move to calculate the average value of the waveform using the accumulated values of the area and time. A line is then skipped; and the average value is displayed with the remaining cout statements. Brackets have been added along the edge of the pro- gram to help identify the various components of the program. A program is now available that can ﬁnd the average value of any pulse waveform having up to ﬁve positive or negative pulses. It can be placed in storage and simply called for when needed. Operations such as the above are not available in either form of PSpice or in any commer- cially available software package. It took the knowledge of a language and a few minutes of time to generate a short program of lifetime value. Two runs will clearly reveal what will be displayed and how the out- put will appear. The waveform of Fig. 13.79 has ﬁve levels, entered as shown in the output ﬁle of Fig. 13.80. As indicated the average value is 1.6 V.

Phasor notation will then be introduced to establish a method of analy- sis that permits a direct correspondence with a number of the methods, theorems, and concepts introduced in the dc chapters. 14.2 THE DERIVATIVE In order to understand the response of the basic R, L, and C elements to a sinusoidal signal, you need to examine the concept of the derivative in some detail. It will not be necessary that you become proﬁcient in the mathematical technique, but simply that you understand the impact of a relationship deﬁned by a derivative. Recall from Section 10.11 that the derivative dx/dt is deﬁned as the rate of change of x with respect to time. If x fails to change at a particu- lar instant, dx \u0001 0, and the derivative is zero. For the sinusoidal wave- form, dx/dt is zero only at the positive and negative peaks (qt \u0001 p/2 and \u0001\u0002p in Fig. 14.1), since x fails to change at these instants of time. The derivative dx/dt is actually the slope of the graph at any instant of time. A close examination of the sinusoidal waveform will also indicate that the greatest change in x will occur at the instants qt \u0001 0, p, and 2p. The derivative is therefore a maximum at these points. At 0 and 2p, x increases at its greatest rate, and the derivative is given a positive sign since x increases with time. At p, dx/dt decreases at the same rate as it increases at 0 and 2p, but the derivative is given a negative sign since x decreases with time. Since the rate of change at 0, p, and 2p is the same, the magnitude of the derivative at these points is the same also. For various values of qt between these maxima and minima, the deriv- ative will exist and will have values from the minimum to the maximum inclusive. A plot of the derivative in Fig. 14.2 shows that the derivative of a sine wave is a cosine wave. \u0002 The Basic Elements and Phasors x1 Higher peak Steeper slope Negative peak Lower peak Less slope Smaller negative peak x2f2f1 > dx1 dt dx2 dt 576  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS \u0002 FIG. 14.1 Deﬁning those points in a sinusoidal waveform that have maximum and minimum derivatives.

FIG. 14.3 Effect of frequency on the peak value of the derivative. The peak value of the cosine wave is directly related to the fre- quency of the original waveform. The higher the frequency, the steeper the slope at the horizontal axis and the greater the value of dx/dt, as shown in Fig. 14.3 for two different frequencies. \u0002 Note in Fig. 14.3 that even though both waveforms (x1 and x2) have the same peak value, the sinusoidal function with the higher frequency produces the larger peak value for the derivative. In addition, note that the derivative of a sine wave has the same period and frequency as the original sinusoidal waveform. For the sinusoidal voltage e(t) \u0001 Em sin(qt \u0003 v) the derivative can be found directly by differentiation (calculus) to pro- duce the following: e(t) \u0001 qEm cos(qt \u0003 v) \u0001 2pfEm cos(qt \u0003 v) (14.1) The mechanics of the differentiation process will not be discussed or investigated here; nor will they be required to continue with the text. Note, however, that the peak value of the derivative, 2pfEm,isa function of the frequency of e(t), and the derivative of a sine wave is a cosine wave. 14.3 RESPONSE OF BASIC R, L, AND C ELEMENTS TO A SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE OR CURRENT Now that we are familiar with the characteristics of the derivative of a sinusoidal function, we can investigate the response of the basic ele- ments R, L, and C to a sinusoidal voltage or current. Resistor For power-line frequencies and frequencies up to a few hundred kilo- hertz, resistance is, for all practical purposes, unaffected by the fre- quency of the applied sinusoidal voltage or current. For this frequency region, the resistor R of Fig. 14.4 can be treated as a constant, and Ohm’s law can be applied as follows. For v \u0001 Vm sin qt, i \u0001\u0001 \u0001 sin qt \u0001 Im sin qt where (14.2) In addition, for a given i, v \u0001 iR \u0001 (Im sin qt)R \u0001 ImR sin qt \u0001 Vm sin qt where (14.3) A plot of v and i in Fig. 14.5 reveals that for a purely resistive element, the voltage across and the current through the element are in phase, with their peak values related by Ohm’s law.

The magnitude of the voltage across the ele- ment is determined by the opposition of the element to the ﬂow of charge, or current i. Fora resistive element, we have found that the opposition is its resistance and that velement and i are determined by velement \u0001 iR. We found in Chapter 12 that the voltage across an inductor is directly related to the rate of change of current through the coil. Conse- quently, the higher the frequency, the greater will be the rate of change of current through the coil, and the greater the magnitude of the volt- age. In addition, we found in the same chapter that the inductance of a coil will determine the rate of change of the ﬂux linking a coil for a par- ticular change in current through the coil. The higher the inductance, the greater the rate of change of the ﬂux linkages, and the greater the resulting voltage across the coil. The inductive voltage, therefore, is directly related to the frequency (or, more speciﬁcally, the angular velocity of the sinusoidal ac current through the coil) and the inductance of the coil. For increasing values of f and L in Fig. 14.7, the magnitude of vL will increase as described above. Utilizing the similarities between Figs. 14.6 and 14.7, we ﬁnd that increasing levels of vL are directly related to increasing levels of oppo- sition in Fig. 14.6. Since vL will increase with both q (\u0001 2pf ) and L, the opposition of an inductive element is as deﬁned in Fig. 14.7. We will now verify some of the preceding conclusions using a more mathematical approach and then deﬁne a few important quantities to be employed in the sections and chapters to follow. For the inductor of Fig. 14.8, we recall from Chapter 12 that vL \u0001 L and, applying differentiation, \u0001 (Im sin qt) \u0001 qIm cos qt Therefore, vL \u0001 L \u0001 L(qIm cos qt) \u0001 qLIm cos qt or vL \u0001 Vm sin(qt \u0005 90°) where Vm \u0001 qLIm Note that the peak value of vL is directly related to q (\u0001 2pf ) and L as predicted in the discussion above. A plot of vL and iL in Fig. 14.9 reveals that for an inductor, vL leads iL by 90°, or iL lags vL by 90°. If a phase angle is included in the sinusoidal expression for iL, such as iL \u0001 Im sin(qt \u0003 v) then vL \u0001 qLIm sin(qt \u0003 v \u0005 90°) diL\u0004 dt d \u0004 dt diL\u0004 dt diL\u0004 dt \u0002 Opposition e i+– +–velement FIG. 14.6 Deﬁning the opposition of an element to the ﬂow of charge through the element.

(4.1): Effect \u0001 which, for our purposes, can be written Opposition \u0001 Substituting values, we have Opposition \u0001\u0001 \u0001 qL revealing that the opposition established by an inductor in an ac sinu- soidal network is directly related to the product of the angular velocity (q \u0001 2pf ) and the inductance, verifying our earlier conclusions. The quantity qL, called the reactance (from the word reaction) of an inductor, is symbolically represented by XL and is measured in ohms; that is, (ohms, \u0006) (14.4) In an Ohm’s law format, its magnitude can be determined from XL \u0001 (ohms, \u0006) (14.5) Inductive reactance is the opposition to the ﬂow of current, which results in the continual interchange of energy between the source and the magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor. In other words, inductive reactance, unlike resistance (which dissipates energy in the form of heat), does not dissipate electrical energy (ignoring the effects of the internal resistance of the inductor). Capacitor Let us now return to the series conﬁguration of Fig. 14.6 and insert the capacitor as the element of interest. For the capacitor, however, we will determine i for a particular voltage across the element. When this approach reaches its conclusion, the relationship between the voltage Vm\u0004 Im XL \u0001 qL qLIm\u0004 Im Vm\u0004 Im cause\u0004 effect cause\u0004\u0004 opposition RESPONSE OF BASIC R, L, AND C ELEMENTS TO A SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE OR CURRENT  579 qt0 p 2p iL vL Vm Im p 2 3 2 p – p 90° L: vL leads iL by 90° 2 FIG. 14.9 For a pure inductor, the voltage across the coil leads the current through the coil by 90°. 580  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS and current will be known, and the opposing voltage (velement) can be determined for any sinusoidal current i. Our investigation of the inductor revealed that the inductive voltage across a coil opposes the instantaneous change in current through the coil. For capacitive networks, the voltage across the capacitor is limited by the rate at which charge can be deposited on, or released by, the plates of the capacitor during the charging and discharging phases, respectively. In other words, an instantaneous change in voltage across a capacitor is opposed by the fact that there is an element of time required to deposit charge on (or release charge from) the plates of a capacitor, and V \u0001 Q/C. Since capacitance is a measure of the rate at which a capacitor will store charge on its plates, for a particular change in voltage across the capacitor, the greater the value of capacitance, the greater will be the resulting capacitive current. In addition, the fundamental equation relating the voltage across a capacitor to the current of a capacitor [i \u0001 C(dv/dt)] indicates that for a particular capacitance, the greater the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor, the greater the capacitive current. Certainly, an increase in frequency corresponds to an increase in the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor and to an increase in the current of the capacitor. The current of a capacitor is therefore directly related to the fre- quency (or, again more speciﬁcally, the angular velocity) and the capac- itance of the capacitor. An increase in either quantity will result in an increase in the current of the capacitor. For the basic conﬁguration of Fig. 14.10, however, we are interested in determining the opposition of the capacitor as related to the resistance of a resistor and qL for the inductor. Since an increase in current corresponds to a decrease in opposition, and iC is proportional to q and C, the opposition of a capac- itor is inversely related to q (\u0001 2pf ) and C. \u0002 Opposition inversely related to f and C e iC+– +–vC C FIG. 14.10 Deﬁning the parameters that determine the opposition of a capacitive element to the ﬂow of the charge. We will now verify, as we did for the inductor, some of the above conclusions using a more mathematical approach. For the capacitor of Fig. 14.11, we recall from Chapter 10 that iC \u0001 C and, applying differentiation, \u0001 (Vm sin qt) \u0001 qVm cos qt d \u0004 dt dvC\u0004 dt dvC\u0004 dt iC = ? vC = Vm sin qt + – C FIG. 14.11 Investigating the sinusoidal response of a capacitive element. \u0002 Therefore, iC \u0001 C \u0001 C(qVm cos qt) \u0001 qCVm cos qt or iC \u0001 Im sin(qt \u0005 90°) where Im \u0001 qCVm Note that the peak value of iC is directly related to q (\u0001 2pf ) and C, as predicted in the discussion above. A plot of vC and iC in Fig. 14.12 reveals that for a capacitor, iC leads vC by 90°, or vC lags iC by 90°. * If a phase angle is included in the sinusoidal expression for vC, such as vC \u0001 Vm sin(qt \u0003 v) then iC \u0001 qCVm sin(qt \u0003 v \u0005 90°) Applying Opposition \u0001 and substituting values, we obtain Opposition \u0001\u0001 \u0001 which agrees with the results obtained above. The quantity 1/qC, called the reactance of a capacitor, is symboli- cally represented by XC and is measured in ohms; that is, XC \u0001 (ohms, \u0006) (14.6) In an Ohm’s law format, its magnitude can be determined from XC \u0001 (ohms, \u0006) (14.7) Capacitive reactance is the opposition to the ﬂow of charge, which results in the continual interchange of energy between the source and the electric ﬁeld of the capacitor. Like the inductor, the capacitor does not dissipate energy in any form (ignoring the effects of the leakage resistance). In the circuits just considered, the current was given in the inductive circuit, and the voltage in the capacitive circuit. This was done to avoid the use of integration in ﬁnding the unknown quantities. In the induc- tive circuit, vL \u0001 L diL\u0004 dt Vm\u0004 Im 1\u0004 qC 1 \u0004 qC Vm\u0004 qCVm Vm\u0004 Im cause\u0004 effect dvC\u0004 dt RESPONSE OF BASIC R, L, AND C ELEMENTS TO A SINUSOIDAL VOLTAGE OR CURRENT  581 qt0 p 2p iC vC Vm Im p 2 – 90° C: iC leads vC by 90°. 3 2 pp 2 FIG. 14.12 The current of a purely capacitive element leads the voltage across the element by 90°. *A mnemonic phrase sometimes used to remember the phase relationship between the voltage and current of a coil and capacitor is “ELI the ICE man.” Note that the L (induc- tor) has the E before the I (e leads i by 90°), and the C (capacitor) has the I before the E (i leads e by 90°). 582  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS but iL \u0001 \u0001 vL dt (14.8) In the capacitive circuit, iC \u0001 C but vC \u0001 \u0001 iC dt (14.9) Shortly, we shall consider a method of analyzing ac circuits that will permit us to solve for an unknown quantity with sinusoidal input with- out having to use direct integration or differentiation. It is possible to determine whether a network with one or more ele- ments is predominantly capacitive or inductive by noting the phase rela- tionship between the input voltage and current. If the source current leads the applied voltage, the network is predominantly capacitive, and if the applied voltage leads the source current, it is predominantly inductive. Since we now have an equation for the reactance of an inductor or capacitor, we do not need to use derivatives or integration in the examples to be considered. Simply applying Ohm’s law, Im \u0001 Em/XL (or XC), and keeping in mind the phase relationship between the volt- age and current for each element, will be sufﬁcient to complete the examples.

Phase Angle Measurements between the Applied Voltage and Source Current Now that we are familiar with phase relationships and understand how the elements affect the phase relationship between the applied voltage and resulting current, the use of the oscilloscope to measure the phase angle can be introduced. Recall from past discussions that the oscillo- scope can be used only to display voltage levels versus time. However, now that we realize that the voltage across a resistor is in phase with the current through a resistor, we can consider the phase angle associ- ated with the voltage across any resistor actually to be the phase angle of the current. For example, suppose that we want to ﬁnd the phase angle introduced by the unknown system of Fig. 14.19(a). In Fig. 14.19(b), a resistor was added to the input leads, and the two channels of a dual trace (most modern-day oscilloscopes can display two sig- nals at the same time) were connected as shown. One channel will dis- play the input voltage vi,whereas the other will display vR,as shown in Fig. 14.19(c). However, as noted before, since vR and iR are in phase, the phase angle appearing in Fig. 14.19(c) is also the phase angle between vi and ii. The addition of a “sensing” resistor (a resis- tor of a magnitude that will not adversely affect the input characteris- tics of the system), therefore, can be used to determine the phase angle introduced by the system and can be used to determine the mag- nitude of the resulting current. The details of the connections that must be made and how the actual phase angle is determined will be left for the laboratory experience.

What is the effect of varying the frequency on the level of opposition offered by a resistive, inductive, or capacitive element? We are aware from the last section that the inductive reactance increases with frequency while the capacitive reactance decreases. However, what is the pattern to this increase or decrease in opposition? Does it con- tinue indeﬁnitely on the same path? Since applied signals may have fre- quencies extending from a few hertz to megahertz, it is important to be aware of the effect of frequency on the opposition level. R Thus far we have assumed that the resistance of a resistor is indepen- dent of the applied frequency. However, in the real world each resistive element has stray capacitance levels and lead inductance that are sensi- tive to the applied frequency. However, the capacitive and inductive lev- els involved are usually so small that their real effect is not noticed until the megahertz range. The resistance-versus-frequency curves for a num- ber of carbon composition resistors are provided in Fig. 14.20. Note that the lower resistance levels seem to be less affected by the fre- quency level. The 100-\u0006 resistor is essentially stable up to about 300 MHz, whereas the 100-k\u0006 resistor starts its radical decline at about 15 MHz. \u0002 Frequency, therefore, does have impact on the resistance of an ele- ment, but for our current frequency range of interest, we will assume the resistance-versus-frequency plot of Fig. 14.21 (like Fig. 14.20 up to 15 MHz), which essentially speciﬁes that the resistance level of a resis- tor is independent of frequency. L For inductors, the equation XL \u0001 qL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2pLf FIG. 14.20 Typical resistance-versus-frequency curves for carbon compound resistors. 05 10 15 20 f(kHz) R FIG. 14.21 R versus f for the range of interest. \u0002 is directly related to the straight-line equation y \u0001 mx \u0005 b \u0001 (2pL)f \u0005 0 with a slope (m) of 2pL and a y-intercept (b) of zero. XL is the y vari- able and f is the x variable, as shown in Fig. 14.22. The larger the inductance, the greater the slope (m \u0001 2pL) for the same frequency range, as shown in Fig. 14.22. Keep in mind, as reem- phasized by Fig. 14.22, that the opposition of an inductor at very low frequencies approaches that of a short circuit, while at high frequencies the reactance approaches that of an open circuit. For the capacitor, the reactance equation XC \u0001 can be written XC f \u0001 which matches the basic format of a hyperbola, yx \u0001 k with y \u0001 XC, x \u0001 f, and the constant k \u0001 1/(2pC). At f \u0001 0 Hz, the reactance of the capacitor is so large, as shown in Fig. 14.23, that it can be replaced by an open-circuit equivalent. As the frequency increases, the reactance decreases, until eventually a short- circuit equivalent would be appropriate. Note that an increase in capac- itance causes the reactance to drop off more rapidly with frequency. In summary, therefore, as the applied frequency increases, the resistance of a resistor remains constant, the reactance of an inductor increases linearly, and the reactance of a capacitor decreases nonlinearly. EXAMPLE 14.8 At what frequency will the reactance of a 200-mH inductor match the resistance level of a 5-k\u0006 resistor?

In other words, the terminal characteristics of an inductance will vary with several factors, such as frequency, temperature, and current. A true equivalent for an inductor appears in Fig. 14.24. The series resis- tance Rs represents the copper losses (resistance of the many turns of thin copper wire); the eddy current losses (which will be described in Chapter 19 and which are losses due to small circular currents in the core when an ac voltage is applied); and the hysteresis losses (which will also be described in Chapter 19 and which are losses due to core losses created by the rapidly reversing ﬁeld in the core). The capaci- tance Cp is the stray capacitance that exists between the windings of the inductor. For most inductors, the construction is usually such that the larger the inductance, the lower the frequency at which the parasitic ele- ments become important. That is, for inductors in the millihenry range (which is very typical), frequencies approaching 100 kHz can have an effect on the ideal characteristics of the element. For inductors in the microhenry range, a frequency of 1 MHz may introduce negative effects. This is not to suggest that the inductors lose their effect at these frequencies but more that they can no longer be considered ideal (purely inductive elements). 105 Hz\u0004 14.05 1\u0004\u0004\u0004 (2p)(2.236 \b 10 \u00075) 590  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS \u0002 ZL Rs Cp L FIG. 14.24 Practical equivalent for an inductor. 1MHz 2 MHz 4 MHz 6 MHz 10 MHz f (log scale) Due to Cp 10 \u0005H 100 \u0005H Due to Cp ZL (\u0004) \u0005 \u0005 ZL ≅ 2 fL\u0001 ZL ≅ 2 fL\u0001 FIG. 14.25 ZL versus frequency for the practical inductor equivalent of Fig. 14.24. Figure 14.25 is a plot of the magnitude of the impedance ZL of Fig. 14.24 versus frequency. Note that up to about 2 MHz the impedance increases almost linearly with frequency, clearly suggesting that the 100-mH inductor is essentially ideal. However, above 2 MHz all the fac- tors contributing to Rs will start to increase, while the reactance due to the capacitive element Cp will be more pronounced. The dropping level of capacitive reactance will begin to have a shorting effect across the windings of the inductor and will reduce the overall inductive effect. Eventually, if the frequency continues to increase, the capacitive effects will overcome the inductive effects, and the element will actually begin to behave in a capacitive fashion. Note the similarities of this region with the curves of Fig. 14.23. Also note that decreasing levels of induc- tance (available with fewer turns and therefore lower levels of Cp) will not demonstrate the degrading effect until higher frequencies are 1\u0004\u0004 2p\u00035\u0004\b\u0004 1\u00040\u0004 \u0007 \u0004 10 \u0004 \u0002 applied. In general, therefore, the frequency of application for a coil becomes important at increasing frequencies. Inductors lose their ideal characteristics and in fact begin to act as capacitive elements with increasing losses at very high frequencies. The capacitor, like the inductor, is not ideal at higher frequencies. In fact, a transition point can be deﬁned where the characteristics of the capacitor will actually be inductive. The complete equivalent model for a capacitor is provided in Fig. 14.26. The resistance Rs, deﬁned by the resistivity of the dielectric (typically 10 12 \u0006·m or better) and the case resistance, will determine the level of leakage current to expect during the discharge cycle. In other words, a charged capacitor can discharge both through the case and through the dielectric at a rate determined by the resistance of each path. Depending on the capacitor, the discharge time can extend from a few seconds for some electrolytic capacitors to hours (paper) or perhaps days (polystyrene). Inversely, therefore, elec- trolytics obviously have much lower levels of Rs than paper or poly- styrene. The resistance Rp reﬂects the energy lost as the atoms continu- ally realign themselves in the dielectric due to the applied alternating ac voltage. Molecular friction is present due to the motion of the atoms as they respond to the alternating applied electric ﬁeld. Interestingly enough, however, the relative permittivity will decrease with increasing frequencies but will eventually take a complete turnaround and begin to increase at very high frequencies. The inductance Ls includes the induc- tance of the capacitor leads and any inductive effects introduced by the design of the capacitor. Be aware that the inductance of the leads is about 0.05 mH per centimeter or 0.2 mH for a capacitor with two 2-cm leads—a level that can be important at high frequencies. As for the inductor, the capacitor will behave quite ideally for the low- and mid-frequency range, as shown by the plot of Fig. 14.27 for a 0.01-mF FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE BASIC ELEMENTS  591 C Rp (leakage) Ls (leads) Rs (dielectric loss) FIG. 14.26 Practical equivalent for a capacitor.

As the frequency increases, however, and the reactance Xs becomes larger, a frequency will eventu- ally be reached where the reactance of the coil equals that of the capac- itor (a resonant condition to be described in Chapter 20). Any additional increase in frequency will simply result in Xs being greater than XC, and the element will behave like an inductor. In general, therefore, the fre- quency of application is important for capacitive elements because 592  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS there comes a point with increasing frequency when the element will take on inductive characteristics. It also points out that the frequency of application deﬁnes the type of capacitor (or inductor) that would be applied: Electrolytics are limited to frequencies up to perhaps 10 kHz, while ceramic or mica can handle frequencies beyond 10 MHz. The expected temperature range of operation can have an important impact on the type of capacitor chosen for a particular application. Electrolytics, tantalum, and some high-k ceramic capacitors are very sensitive to colder temperatures. In fact, most electrolytics lose 20% of their room-temperature capacitance at 0°C (freezing). Higher tempera- tures (up to 100°C or 212°F) seem to have less of an impact in general than colder temperatures, but high-k ceramics can lose up to 30% of their capacitance level at 100°C compared to room temperature. With exposure and experience, you will learn the type of capacitor employed for each application, and concern will arise only when very high fre- quencies, extreme temperatures, or very high currents or voltages are encountered. 14.5 AVERAGE POWER AND POWER FACTOR For any load in a sinusoidal ac network, the voltage across the load and the current through the load will vary in a sinusoidal nature. The ques- tions then arise, How does the power to the load determined by the product v·i vary, and what ﬁxed value can be assigned to the power since it will vary with time? If we take the general case depicted in Fig. 14.28 and use the fol- lowing for v and i: v \u0001 Vm sin(qt \u0005 vv) i \u0001 Im sin(qt \u0005 vi) then the power is deﬁned by p \u0001 vi \u0001 Vm sin(qt \u0005 vv)Im sin(qt \u0005 vi) \u0001 VmIm sin(qt \u0005 vv) sin(qt \u0005 vi) Using the trigonometric identity sin A sin B \u0001 the function sin(qt \u0005 vv) sin(qt \u0005 vi) becomes sin(qt \u0005 vv) sin(qt \u0005 vi) \u0001 \u0001 so that Fixed value Time-varying (function of t) p \u0001 \u0005 cos(vv \u0007 vi)\u0006 \u0007 \u0005 cos(2qt \u0005 vv \u0005 vi)\u0006 A plot of v, i, and p on the same set of axes is shown in Fig. 14.29.

The average value of this term is zero over one cycle, producing no net transfer of energy in any one direction. The ﬁrst term in the preceding equation, however, has a constant magnitude (no time dependence) and therefore provides some net trans- fer of energy. This term is referred to as the average power, the reason for which is obvious from Fig. 14.29. The average power, or real power as it is sometimes called, is the power delivered to and dissi- pated by the load. It corresponds to the power calculations performed for dc networks. The angle (vv \u0007 vi ) is the phase angle between v and i. Since cos(\u0007a) \u0001 cos a, the magnitude of average power delivered is independent of whether v leads i or i leads v. Deﬁning v as equal to |vv \u0007 vi|, where || indicates that only the mag- nitude is important and the sign is immaterial, we have (watts, W) (14.14) where P is the average power in watts.

No matter how large the voltage or current, if cos v \u0001 0, the power is zero; if cos v \u0001 1, the power delivered is a maximum. Since it has such control, the expression was given the name power factor and is deﬁned by (14.18) Fora purely resistive load such as the one shown in Fig. 14.30, the phase angle between v and i is 0° and Fp \u0001 cos v \u0001 cos 0° \u0001 1. The power delivered is a maximum of (VmIm/2) cos v \u0001 ((100 V)(5 A)/2) \t (1) \u0001 250 W. For a purely reactive load (inductive or capacitive) such as the one shown in Fig. 14.31, the phase angle between v and i is 90° and Fp \u0001 cos v \u0001 cos 90° \u0001 0. The power delivered is then the minimum value of zero watts, even though the current has the same peak value as that encountered in Fig. 14.30. For situations where the load is a combination of resistive and reactive elements, the power factor will vary between 0 and 1. The more resistive the total impedance, the closer the power factor is to 1; the more reactive the total impedance, the closer the power factor is to 0.

They are deﬁned by the current through the load. If the current leads the voltage across a load, the load has a leading power factor. If the current lags the voltage across the load, the load has a lagging power factor. In other words, capacitive networks have leading power factors, and inductive networks have lagging power factors. The importance of the power factor to power distribution systems is examined in Chapter 19. In fact, one section is devoted to power-factor correction. EXAMPLE 14.12 Determine the power factors of the following loads, and indicate whether they are leading or lagging: a. Fig. 14.32 b. Fig. 14.33 c. Fig. 14.34 Solutions: a.

Since the same will also be true for ac networks, the question arises, How do we determine the algebraic sum of two or more voltages (or currents) that are varying sinusoidally? Although one solution would be to ﬁnd the algebraic sum on a point-to- point basis (as shown in Section 14.12), this would be a long and tedious process in which accuracy would be directly related to the scale employed. It is the purpose of this chapter to introduce a system of complex numbers that, when related to the sinusoidal ac waveform, will result in a technique for ﬁnding the algebraic sum of sinusoidal waveforms that is quick, direct, and accurate. In the following chapters, the tech- nique will be extended to permit the analysis of sinusoidal ac networks in a manner very similar to that applied to dc networks. The methods and theorems as described for dc networks can then be applied to sinu- soidal ac networks with little difﬁculty. A complex number represents a point in a two-dimensional plane located with reference to two distinct axes. This point can also deter- mine a radius vector drawn from the origin to the point. The horizontal axis is called the real axis, while the vertical axis is called the imagi- nary axis. Both are labeled in Fig. 14.35. Every number from zero to \u0003∞ can be represented by some point along the real axis.

In the complex plane, the horizontal or real axis represents all posi- tive numbers to the right of the imaginary axis and all negative numbers to the left of the imaginary axis. All positive imaginary numbers are represented above the real axis, and all negative imaginary numbers, below the real axis. The symbol j (or sometimes i) is used to denote the imaginary component. Two forms are used to represent a complex number: rectangular and polar. Each can represent a point in the plane or a radius vector drawn from the origin to that point. 14.7 RECTANGULAR FORM The format for the rectangular form is (14.20) as shown in Fig. 14.36. The letter C was chosen from the word “com- plex.” The boldface notation is for any number with magnitude and direction. The italic is for magnitude only.

Angles measured in the clockwise direction from the positive real axis must have a negative sign associated with them. A negative sign in front of the polar form has the effect shown in Fig. 14.41. Note that it results in a complex number directly opposite the complex number with a positive sign. (14.22) EXAMPLE 14.14 Sketch the following complex numbers in the com- plex plane: a.

A few basic rules and deﬁnitions must be understood before considering these operations. Let us ﬁrst examine the symbol j associated with imaginary num- bers.

For example, the conjugate of C \u0001 2 \u0005 j3 is 2 \u0007 j3 as shown in Fig. 14.50.

Addition To add two or more complex numbers, simply add the real and imagi- nary parts separately.

Fortunately, technologists of today have calculators and com- puter methods that make the process measurably easier with higher degrees of reliability and accuracy. Calculators The TI-86 calculator of Fig. 14.58 is only one of numerous calculators that can convert from one form to another and perform lengthy calcula- tions with complex numbers in a concise, neat form. Not all of the details of using a speciﬁc calculator will be included here because each has its own format and sequence of steps. However, the basic operations with the TI-86 will be included primarily to demonstrate the ease with which the conversions can be made and the format for more complex operations. For the TI-86 calculator, one must ﬁrst call up the 2nd function CPLX from the keyboard, which results in a menu at the bottom of the display including conj, real, imag, abs, and angle. If we choose the key MORE, \u0002 Rec and \u0002 Pol will appear as options (for the conversion process). To convert from one form to another, simply enter the current form in brackets with a comma between components for the rectangu- lar form and an angle symbol for the polar form. Follow this form with the operation to be performed, and press the ENTER key—the result will appear on the screen in the desired format. EXAMPLE 14.27 This example is for demonstration purposes only. It is not expected that all readers will have a TI-86 calculator. The sole purpose of the example is to demonstrate the power of today’s calcula- tors. Using the TI-86 calculator, perform the following conversions: a. 3 \u0005 j 4 to polar form. b. 0.006 \u000120.6° to rectangular form. Solutions: a.

We will continue to use j when we deﬁne a complex number in rectangular form even though the Math- cad result will always appear with the letter i. You can change this by going to the Format menu, but for this presentation we decided to use the default operators as much as possible. When entering j to deﬁne the imaginary component of a complex number, be sure to enter it as 1j; but do not put a multiplication opera- tor between the 1 and the j. Just type 1 and then j. In addition, place the j after the constant rather than before as in the text material. When Mathcad operates on an angle, it will assume that the angle is in radians and not degrees. Further, all results will appear in radians rather than degrees. The ﬁrst operation to be developed is the conversion from rectangu- lar to polar form. In Fig. 14.59 the rectangular number 4 \u0003 j 3 is being converted to polar form using Mathcad. First X and Y are deﬁned using the colon operator. Next the equation for the magnitude of the polar form is written in terms of the two variables just deﬁned. The magni- tude of the polar form is then revealed by writing the variable again and using the equal sign. It will take some practice, but be careful when writing the equation for Z in the sense that you pay particular attention to the location of the bracket before performing the next operation. The resulting magnitude of 5 is as expected. For the angle, the sequence View-Toolbars-Greek is ﬁrst applied to obtain the Greek toolbar appearing in Fig. 14.59. It can be moved to any location by simply clicking on the blue at the top of the toolbar and dragging it to the preferred location. Then 0 is selected from the toolbar as the variable to be deﬁned. The tan\u00051 v is obtained through the sequence Insert-f(x)-Insert Function dialog box-trigonometric-atan- OK in which Y/X is inserted. Then bring the controlling bracket to the outside of the entire expression, and multiply by the ratio of 180/p with p selected from the Calculator toolbar (available from the same sequence used to obtain the Greek toolbar). The multiplication by the last factor of the equation will ensure that the angle is in degrees. Selecting v again followed by an equal sign will result in the correct angle of 36.87° as shown in Fig. 14.59. We will now look at two forms for the polar form of a complex num- ber. The ﬁrst is deﬁned by the basic equations introduced in this chap- ter, while the second uses a special format. For all the Mathcad analy- ses to be provided in this text, the latter format will be employed. First which is a perfect match with the earlier solution. German-American (Breslau, Germany; Yonkers and Schenectady, NY, USA) (1865–1923) Mathematician, Scientist, Engineer, Inventor, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Electrophysics, Union College Department Head, General Electric Co. Although the holder of some 200 patents and recog- nized worldwide for his contributions to the study of hysteresis losses and electrical transients, Charles Proteus Steinmetz is best recognized for his contri- bution to the study of ac networks. His “Symbolic Method of Alternating-current Calculations” pro- vided an approach to the analysis of ac networks that removed a great deal of the confusion and frus- tration experienced by engineers of that day as they made the transition from dc to ac systems. His approach (from which the phasor notation of this text is premised) permitted a direct analysis of ac systems using many of the theorems and methods of analysis developed for dc systems. In 1897 he authored the epic work Theory and Calculation of Alternating Current Phenomena, which became the “bible” for practicing engineers. Dr. Steinmetz was fondly referred to as “The Doctor” at General Elec- tric Company where he worked for some 30 years in a number of important capacities. His recognition as a “multigifted genius” is supported by the fact that he maintained active friendships with such individu- als as Albert Einstein, Guglielmo Marconi (radio), and Thomas A. Edison, to name just a few. He was President of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the National Association of Corporation Schools and actively supported his local community (Schenectady) as president of the Board of Education and the Commission on Parks and City Planning. CHARLES PROTEUS STEINMETZ Courtesy of the Hall of History Foundation, Schenectady, New York \u0001 the magnitude of the polar form is deﬁned followed by the conversion of the angle of 60° to radians by multiplying by the factor p\u0001180 as shown in Fig. 14.60. In this example the resulting angular measure is p\u00013 radians. Next the rectangular format is deﬁned by a real part X \u0002 Z cos v and by an imaginary part Y \u0002 Z sin v. Both the cos and the sin are obtained by the sequence Insert-f(x)-trigonometric-cos(or sin)- OK. Note the multiplication by j which was actually entered as 1j. Entering C again followed by an equal sign will result in the correct conversion shown in Fig. 14.60. The next format is based on the mathematical relationship that e jv \u0002 cos v \u0003 j sin v. Both Z and v are as deﬁned above, but now the complex number is written as shown in Fig. 14.60 using the notation just intro- duced. Note that both Z and v are part of this deﬁning form. The ex is obtained directly from the Calculator toolbar. Remember to enter the j as 1j without a multiplication sign between the 1 and the j. However, there is a multiplication operator placed between the j and v. When entered again followed by an equal sign, the rectangular form appears to match the above results. As mentioned above, it is this latter format that will be used throughout the text due to its cleaner form and more direct entering path. The last example using Mathcad will be a conﬁrmation of the results of Example 14.26(b) as shown in Fig. 14.61. The three complex num- bers are ﬁrst deﬁned as shown.

Note the rela- tive simplicity of the equation for C4 now that all the other variables have been deﬁned. As shown, however, the immediate result is in the rectangular form using the magnitude feature from the calculator and the arg function from Insert-f(x)-Complex Numbers-arg. There will be a number of other examples in the chapters to follow on the use of Mathcad with complex numbers. 14.12 PHASORS As noted earlier in this chapter, the addition of sinusoidal voltages and currents will frequently be required in the analysis of ac circuits. One lengthy but valid method of performing this operation is to place both sinusoidal waveforms on the same set of axes and add alge- braically the magnitudes of each at every point along the abscissa, as shown for c \u0002 a \u0003 b in Fig. 14.62. This, however, can be a long and tedious process with limited accuracy. A shorter method uses the rotating radius vector ﬁrst appearing in Fig. 13.16. This radius vector, having a constant magnitude (length) with one end ﬁxed at the ori- gin, is called a phasor when applied to electric circuits. During its rotational development of the sine wave, the phasor will, at the instant t \u0002 0, have the positions shown in Fig. 14.63(a) for each waveform in Fig. 14.63(b). v1 a b 0 t v2 vT = v1 + v2c = a + b v FIG. 14.62 Adding two sinusoidal waveforms on a point-by-point basis. Note in Fig. 14.63(b) that v2 passes through the horizontal axis at t \u0002 0s, requiring that the radius vector in Fig. 14.63(a) be on the hori- zontal axis to ensure a vertical projection of zero volts at t \u0002 0s. Its length in Fig. 14.63(a) is equal to the peak value of the sinusoid as required by the radius vector of Fig. 13.16. The other sinusoid has passed through 90° of its rotation by the time t \u0002 0sis reached and 612  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS therefore has its maximum vertical projection as shown in Fig. 14.63(a). Since the vertical projection is a maximum, the peak value of the sinu- soid that it will generate is also attained at t \u0002 0s,as shown in Fig. 14.63(b). Note also that vT \u0002 v1 at t \u0002 0s since v2 \u0002 0V at this instant. It can be shown [see Fig. 14.63(a)] using the vector algebra described in Section 14.10 that 1 V \u00010° \u0003 2 V \u000190° \u0002 2.236 V \u000163.43° In other words, if we convert v1 and v2 to the phasor form using v \u0002 Vm sin(qt \u0004 v) ⇒ Vm \u0001\u0004v and add them using complex number algebra, we can ﬁnd the phasor form for vT with very little difﬁculty. It can then be converted to the time domain and plotted on the same set of axes, as shown in Fig. 14.63(b). Figure 14.63(a), showing the magnitudes and relative posi- tions of the various phasors, is called a phasor diagram. It is actually a “snapshot” of the rotating radius vectors at t \u0002 0 s. In the future, therefore, if the addition of two sinusoids is required, they should ﬁrst be converted to the phasor domain and the sum found using complex algebra. The result can then be converted to the time domain. \u0001 1 V 2 V v 2.236 V 1 V 2.236 V2 V (a) (b) v1 = 2 sin ( t + 90°)\u0002 vT = v1 + v2 = 2.236 sin ( t + 63.43°)\u0002 v2 = 1 sin t\u0002 t\u0002 2 (0°) (t = 0 s) θ 1 = 90° θ T = 63.43° θ 2 = 0°θ T = 63.43°θ 1 = 90°θ FIG. 14.63 (a) The phasor representation of the sinusoidal waveforms of Fig. 14.63(b); (b) ﬁnding the sum of two sinusoidal waveforms of v1 and v2. \u0001 PHASORS  613 The case of two sinusoidal functions having phase angles different from 0° and 90° appears in Fig. 14.64. Note again that the vertical height of the functions in Fig. 14.64(b) at t \u0002 0 s is determined by the rotational positions of the radius vectors in Fig. 14.64(a). Since the rms, rather than the peak, values are used almost exclu- sively in the analysis of ac circuits, the phasor will now be redeﬁned for the purposes of practicality and uniformity as having a magnitude equal to the rms value of the sine wave it represents. The angle associated with the phasor will remain as previously described—the phase angle. In general, for all of the analyses to follow, the phasor form of a sinusoidal voltage or current will be V \u0002 V \u0001v and I \u0002 I \u0001v where V and I are rms values and v is the phase angle. It should be pointed out that in phasor notation, the sine wave is always the refer- ence, and the frequency is not represented. Phasor algebra for sinusoidal quantities is applicable only for waveforms having the same frequency.

The ac source of Fig. \u0001 COMPUTER ANALYSIS  617 14.69 is obtained through Place part key-SOURCE-VSIN-OK. The name or value of any parameter can be changed by simply double- clicking on the parameter on the display or by double-clicking on the source symbol to get the Property Editor dialog box. Within the dia- log box the values appearing in Fig. 14.69 were set, and under Display, Name and Value were selected. After you have selected Apply and exited the dialog box, the parameters will appear as shown in the ﬁgure. The simulation process is initiated by selecting the New Simulation Proﬁle and under New Simulation entering Transientac for the Name followed by Create. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, Analysis is selected and Time Domain(Transient) is chosen under Analysis type. The Run to time will be set at 3 ms to permit a display of three cycles of the sinusoidal waveforms (T \u0002 1/f \u0002 1/1000 Hz \u0002 1 ms). The Start saving data after will be left at 0 s, and the Maximum step size will be 3 ms/1000 \u0002 3 ms. Clicking OK and then selecting the Run PSpice icon will result in a plot having a horizontal axis that extends from 0 to 3 ms. Now we have to tell the computer which waveforms we are inter- ested in. First, we should take a look at the applied ac source by select- ing Trace-Add Trace-V(Vs:\u0001) followed by OK. The result is the sweeping ac voltage in the botttom region of the screen of Fig. 14.70. Note that it has a peak value of 5 V, and three cycles appear in the 3-ms time frame. The current for the capacitor can be added by selecting Trace-Add Trace and choosing I(C) followed by OK. The resulting waveform for I(C) appears at a 90° phase shift from the applied volt- age, with the current leading the voltage (the current has already peaked FIG. 14.69 Using PSpice to analyze the response of a capacitor to a sinusoidal ac signal. as the voltage crosses the 0-V axis). Since the peak value of each plot is in the same magnitude range, the 5 appearing on the vertical scale can be used for both. A theoretical analysis would result in XC \u0002 2.34 \b, and the peak value of IC \u0002 E/XC \u0002 5 V/2.34 \b \u0002 2.136 A, as shown in Fig. 14.70. For interest sake, and a little bit of practice, let us obtain the curve for the power delivered to the capacitor over the same time period. First select Plot-Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace to obtain the Add Traces dialog box. Then chose V(Vs:\u0001), follow it with a * for multi- plication, and ﬁnish by selecting I(C). The result is the expression V(Vs:\u0001)*I(C) of the power format: p \u0002 vi. Click OK, and the power plot at the top of Fig 14.70 will appear. Note that over the full three cycles, the area above the axis equals the area below—there is no net transfer of power over the 3-ms period. Note also that the power curve is sinusoidal (which is quite interesting) with a frequency twice that of the applied signal. Using the cursor control, we can determine that the maximum power (peak value of the sinusoidal waveform) is 5.34 W. The cursors, in fact, have been added to the lower curves to show the peak value of the applied sinusoid and the resulting current. After selecting the Toggle cursor icon, left-click the mouse to sur- round the V(Vs:\u0001) at the bottom of the plot with a dashed line to show that the cursor is providing the levels of that quantity. When placed at 1⁄4 of the total period of 250 ms (A1), the peak value is exactly 5 V as 618  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS \u0001 FIG. 14.70 A plot of the voltage, current, and power for the capacitor of Fig. 14.69. \u0001 COMPUTER ANALYSIS  619 FIG. 14.71 Using Electronics Workbench to review the response of an inductive element to a sinusoidal ac signal. shown in the Probe Cursor dialog box. Placing the cursor over the symbol next to I(C) at the bottom of the plot and right-clicking the mouse will assign the right cursor to the current. Placing it at exactly 1 ms (A2) will result in a peak value of 2.136 A to match the solution above. To further distinguish between the voltage and current wave- forms, the color and the width of the lines of the traces were changed. Place the cursor right on the plot line and perform a right click. Then the Properties option appears. When Properties is selected, a Trace Properties dialog box will appear in which the yellow color can be selected and the width widened to improve the visibility on the black background. Note that yellow was chosen for Vs and green for I(C). Note also that the axis and the grid have been changed to a more visi- ble color using the same procedure. Electronics Workbench Since PSpice reviewed the response of a capacitive element to an ac voltage, Electronics Workbench will repeat the analysis for an inductive element. The ac voltage source was derived from the Sources parts bin as described in Chapter 13 with the values appearing in Fig. 14.71 set in the AC Voltage dialog box. Since the transient response of Electronics Workbench is limited to a plot of voltage versus time, a plot of the cur- rent of the circuit will require the addition of a resistor of 1 \b in series 620  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS with the inductive element. The magnitude of the current through the resistor and, of course, the series inductor will then be determined by | iR | \u0002 || \u0002 || \u0002 | vR | \u0002 | iL | revealing that the current will have the same peak value as the voltage across the resistor due to the division by 1. When viewed on the graph, it can simply be considered a plot of the current. In actuality, all inductors require a series resistance, so the 1-\b resistor serves an important dual purpose. The 1-\b resistance is also so small compared to the reactance of the coil at the 1-kHz frequency that its effect on the total impedance or voltage across the coil can be ignored. Once the circuit has been constructed, the sequence Simulate- Analyses-Transient Analysis will result in a Transient Analysis dia- log box in which the Start time is set at 0 s and the End time at 105 ms. The 105 ms was set as the End time to give the network 100 ms to set- tle down in its steady-state mode and 5 ms for ﬁve cycles in the output display. The Minimum number of time points was set at 10,000 to ensure a good display for the rapidly changing waveforms. Next the Output variables heading was chosen within the dialog box, and nodes 1 and 2 were moved from the Variables in Circuit to Selected variables for analysis using the Plot during simulation key pad. Choosing Simulate will then result in a waveform that extends from 0 s to 105 ms. Even though we plan to save only the response that occurs after 100 ms, the computer is unaware of our interest, and it plots the response for the entire period, This is corrected by selecting the Properties key pad in the toolbar at the top of the graph (it looks like a tag and pencil) to obtain the Graph Properties dialog box. Selecting Bottom Axis will permit setting the Range from a Minimum of 0.100s\u0004100ms to a Maximum of 0.105s\u0004105ms. Click OK, and the time period of Fig. 14.71 will be displayed. The grid structure is added by selecting the Show/Hide Grid key pad, and the color associ- ated with each nodal voltage will be displayed if we choose the Show/Hide Legend key next to it. The scale for the plot of iL can be improved by ﬁrst going to Traces and setting the Trace to the number 2 representing the voltage across the 1-\b resistor. When 2 is selected, the Color displayed will automat- icaly change to blue. In the Y Range, select Right Axis followed by OK. Then select the Right Axis heading, and enter Current(A) for the Label, enable Axis, change the Pen Size to 1, and change the Range from \u0005500 mA to \u0003500 mA. Finally, set the Total Ticks at 8 with Minor Ticks at 2 to match the Left Axis, and leave the box with an OK. The plot of Fig. 14.71 will result. Take immediate note of the new axis on the right and the Current(A) label. We can now see that the current has a peak of about 160 mA. For more detail on the peak val- ues, simply click on the Show/Hide Cursors key pad on the top tool- bar. A Transient Analysis dialog box will appear with a 1 and a red line to indicate that it is working on the full source voltage at node 1. To switch to the current curve (the blue curve), simply bring the cursor to any point on the blue curve and perform a left click. A blue line and the number 2 will appear at the heading of the Transient Analysis dia- log box. Clicking on the 1 in the small inverted arrow at the top will allow you to drag the vertical red line to any horizontal point on the graph. As shown in Fig. 14.71, when the cursor is set on 101.5 ms (x1), vR\u0006 1\b vR\u0006 R \u0001\u0001 COMPUTER ANALYSIS  621 the peak value of the current curve is 159.05 mA (y1). A second cursor appears in blue with a number 2 in the inverted arrowhead that can also be moved with a left click on the number 2 at the top of the line. If set at 101.75 ms (x2), it has a minimum value of \u00055.18 mA (y2), the smallest value available for the calculated data points. Note that the dif- ference between horizontal time values dx \u0002 252 ms \u0002 0.25 ms which is 1⁄4 of the period of the wave (at 1 ms). C\u0001\u0001 The versatility of the C\u0003\u0003 programming language is clearly demon- strated by the following program designed to perform conversions between the polar and rectangular forms. Comments are provided on the right side of the program to help identify the function of speciﬁc lines or sections of the program. Recall that any comments to the right of the parallel slash bars // are ignored by the compiler. In this case the ﬁle math.h must be added to the preprocessor directive list, as shown in Fig. 14.72, to provide the mathematical functions to be employed in the program. A complete list of operations can be found in the compiler ref- erence manual. The #deﬁne directive deﬁnes the level of PI to be employed when called for in the program and speciﬁes the operations to be performed when SQR(N) and SGN(N) appear. The ? associated with the SGN(N) directive is a conditional operator that speciﬁes \u00031 if N is greater than or equal to 0 and \u00051 if not. Next the variables are introduced and deﬁned as ﬂoating points. The next entry includes the term void to indicate that the variable to \u0005 polar will not return a speciﬁc numerical value when part of an execution but rather may identify a subroutine or string of words or characters. The void within the parentheses reveals that the variable does not have a list of parameters associated with it for possible use in an application. As described in earlier programs the main () deﬁnes the point at which execution will begin, with the body of main deﬁned by the open- ing and closing braces { }. Within main, an integer variable choice is introduced to handle the integer number (1 or 2) which the user will choose in response to the question posed under cout. Through cin the user will respond with a 1 or 2, which will deﬁne the variable choice. The switch is a conditional response that will follow a path deﬁned by the variable choice. The possible paths for the program to follow under switch are enclosed in the braces { }. Since a numerical value will determine the path, the options must begin with the word case. In this case, a 1 will follow the to_polar structured variable, and a 2 will fol- low the to_rectangular structured variable. The break simply marks the end of the selection process. On a to_polar choice the program will move to the subroutine void to_polar and will convert the number to the polar form. The ﬁrst six lines simply create line shifts and ask for the values of X and Y. The next line calculates the magnitude of the polar form (Z)using SQR(N ), deﬁned above, and the sqrt from the math.h header ﬁle. An if statement sensitive to the value of X and Y will then delineate which line will determine the phase angle of the polar form. The SGN(N ), as introduced in the pre- processor listing, will determine the sign to be employed in the equation. The a preceding the tan function indicates arc tan or tan \u00051, while PI is as deﬁned above in the preprocessor section. Note also that the angles must 622  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS \u0001 FIG. 14.72 C\u0003\u0003 program for complex number conversions.

Once determined, the polar form is printed out using the cout statements. Choosing the to_rectangular structured variable will cause the pro- gram to bypass the above subroutine and move directly to the polar- to-rectangular-conversion sequence. Again, the ﬁrst six lines simply ask for the components of the polar form. The real and imaginary parts are then calculated and the results printed out. Note the if-else statement required to associate the properly signed j with the imaginary part. In an effort to clearly identify the major components of the program, brackets have been added at the edge of the program with a short description of the function performed. As mentioned earlier, do not be concerned if a number of questions arise about the program structure or speciﬁc commands or statements. The purpose here is simply to intro- duce the basic format of the C\u0003\u0003 programming language and not to provide all the details required to write your own programs. Two runs of the program have been provided in Figs. 14.73 and 14.74, one for a polar-to-rectangular conversion and the other for a rec- tangular-to-polar conversion. Note in each case the result of the cout and cin statements and in general the clean, clear, and direct format of the resulting output. 624  THE BASIC ELEMENTS AND PHASORS \u0001 PROBLEMS SECTION 14.2 The Derivative 1.

The close relationship that exists between this method for solving for unknown quantities and the approach used for dc circuits will become apparent after a few simple examples are considered. Once this association is established, many of the rules (current divider rule, voltage divider rule, and so on) for dc circuits can be readily applied to ac circuits. SERIES ac CIRCUITS 15.2 IMPEDANCE AND THE PHASOR DIAGRAM Resistive Elements In Chapter 14, we found, for the purely resistive circuit of Fig. 15.1, that v and i were in phase, and the magnitude Im \u0001 \u0002 V R m \u0002 or Vm \u0001 ImR a c R v = Vm sin qt + – i = Im sin qt FIG. 15.1 Resistive ac circuit. Series and Parallel ac Circuits a c In phasor form, v \u0001 Vm sin qt ⇒ V \u0001 V \u00010° where V \u0001 0.707Vm. Applying Ohm’s law and using phasor algebra, we have I \u0001\u0001 /0° \u0003 vR Since i and v are in phase, the angle associated with i also must be 0°. To satisfy this condition, vR must equal 0°. Substituting vR \u0001 0°, we ﬁnd I \u0001\u0001 /0° \u0003 0° \u0001 \u00010° so that in the time domain, i \u0001 \u00012\u0002\u0003\u0004 sin qt The fact that vR \u0001 0° will now be employed in the following polar format to ensure the proper phase relationship between the voltage and current of a resistor: (15.1) The boldface roman quantity ZR, having both magnitude and an associated angle, is referred to as the impedance of a resistive element. It is measured in ohms and is a measure of how much the element will “impede” the ﬂow of charge through the network. The above format will prove to be a useful “tool” when the networks become more com- plex and phase relationships become less obvious. It is important to realize, however, that ZR is not a phasor, even though the format R\u00010° is very similar to the phasor notation for sinusoidal currents and volt- ages. The term phasor is reserved for quantities that vary with time, and R and its associated angle of 0° are ﬁxed, nonvarying quantities.

For example, the pha- sor diagrams of the circuits considered in the two preceding examples would be as shown in Fig. 15.6. In both cases, it is immediately obvi- ous that v and i are in phase since they both have the same phase angle. FIG. 15.5 Waveforms for Example 15.2.

To satisfy this condition, vL must equal \u000490°. Substituting vL \u0001 90°, we obtain I \u0001\u0001 /0° \u0003 90° \u0001 \u0001\u000390° so that in the time domain, i \u0001 \u00012\u0002\u0003\u0004 sin(qt \u0003 90°) The fact that vL \u0001 90° will now be employed in the following polar format for inductive reactance to ensure the proper phase relationship between the voltage and current of an inductor. ZL \u0001 XL \u000190° (15.2) The boldface roman quantity ZL, having both magnitude and an associated angle, is referred to as the impedance of an inductive ele- ment. It is measured in ohms and is a measure of how much the induc- tive element will “control or impede” the level of current through the network (always keep in mind that inductive elements are storage devices and do not dissipate like resistors). The above format, like that deﬁned for the resistive element, will prove to be a useful “tool” in the analysis of ac networks. Again, be aware that ZL is not a phasor quan- tity, for the same reasons indicated for a resistive element. EXAMPLE 15.3 Using complex algebra, ﬁnd the current i for the cir- cuit of Fig. 15.8.

To satisfy this condition, vC must equal \u000390°. Substituting vC \u0001\u000390° yields I \u0001\u0001 /0° \u0003 (\u000390°) \u0001 \u000190° so, in the time domain, i \u0001 \u00012\u0002\u0003\u0004 sin(qt \u0004 90°) The fact that vC \u0001\u000390° will now be employed in the following polar format for capacitive reactance to ensure the proper phase rela- tionship between the voltage and current of a capacitor. (15.3) The boldface roman quantity ZC, having both magnitude and an associated angle, is referred to as the impedance of a capacitive ele- ment. It is measured in ohms and is a measure of how much the capac- itive element will “control or impede” the level of current through the network (always keep in mind that capacitive elements are storage devices and do not dissipate like resistors). The above format, like that deﬁned for the resistive element, will prove a very useful “tool” in the analysis of ac networks. Again, be aware that ZC is not a phasor quan- tity, for the same reasons indicated for a resistive element. EXAMPLE 15.5 Using complex algebra, ﬁnd the current i for the cir- cuit of Fig. 15.14.

For any network, the resistance will always appear on the positive real axis, the inductive reactance on the positive imaginary axis, and the capacitive reactance on the negative imaginary axis. The result is an impedance diagram that can reﬂect the individual and total impedance levels of an ac network. We will ﬁnd in the sections and chapters to follow that networks combining different types of elements will have total impedances that extend from \u000390° to \u000490°. If the total impedance has an angle of 0°, it is said to be resistive in nature. If it is closer to 90°, it is inductive in nature; and if it is closer to \u000390°, it is capacitive in nature. Of course, for single-element networks the angle associated with the impedance will be the same as that of the resistive or reactive element, as revealed by Eqs. (15.1) through (15.3). It is important to stay aware that impedance, like resistance or reactance, is not a phasor quantity representing a time-varying function with a particular phase shift. It is simply an operating “tool” that is extremely useful in determining the magnitude and angle of quantities in a sinusoidal ac network. Once the total impedance of a network is determined, its magnitude will deﬁne the resulting current level (through Ohm’s law), whereas its angle will reveal whether the network is primarily inductive or capaci- tive or simply resistive. For any conﬁguration (series, parallel, series-parallel, etc.), the angle associated with the total impedance is the angle by which the applied voltage leads the source current. For inductive networks, vT will be positive, whereas for capacitive networks, vT will be negative. 15.3 SERIES CONFIGURATION The overall properties of series ac circuits (Fig. 15.20) are the same as those for dc circuits. For instance, the total impedance of a system is the sum of the individual impedances: (15.4)ZT \u0001 Z1 \u0004 Z2 \u0004 Z3 \u0004 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \u0004 ZN a c I ZT I I I ZNZ3Z2Z1 I FIG. 15.20 Series impedances.

Note that in this example, series inductive and capacitive reactances are in direct oppo- sition. For the circuit of Fig. 15.23, if the inductive reactance were equal to the capacitive reactance, the input impedance would be purely resistive. We will have more to say about this particular condition in a later chapter. For the representative series ac conﬁguration of Fig. 15.25 having two impedances, the current is the same through each element (as it was for the series dc circuits) and is determined by Ohm’s law: ZT \u0001 Z1 \u0004 Z2 and (15.5) The voltage across each element can then be found by another applica- tion of Ohm’s law: (15.6a) (15.6b) Kirchhoff’s voltage law can then be applied in the same manner as it is employed for dc circuits. However, keep in mind that we are now dealing with the algebraic manipulation of quantities that have both magnitude and direction.

ZT Let us ﬁrst determine how the impedance of the circuit ZT will vary with frequency for the speciﬁed frequency range of interest. Before getting into speciﬁcs, however, let us ﬁrst develop a sense for what we should expect by noting the impedance-versus-frequency curve of each element, as drawn in Fig. 15.46. At low frequencies the reactance of the capacitor will be quite high and considerably more than the level of the resistance R, suggesting that the total impedance will be primarily capacitive in nature. At high fre- quencies the reactance XC will drop below the R \u0001 5-k\u0004 level, and the network will start to shift toward one of a purely resistive nature (at 5k\u0004). The frequency at which XC \u0001 R can be determined in the fol- lowing manner: XC \u0001\u0001 R and XC \u0001 R (15.11)f1 \u0001 \u0002 2p 1 RC \u0002 1\u0002 2pf1C 648  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS which for the network of interest is f1 \u0001 \u0003 3183.1 Hz For frequencies less than f1, XC > R, and for frequencies greater than f1, R > XC, as shown in Fig. 15.46. Now for the details. The total impedance is determined by the fol- lowing equation: ZT \u0001 R \u0003 j XC and (15.12) The magnitude and angle of the total impedance can now be found at any frequency of interest by simply substituting into Eq. (15.12).

A plot of vC versus fre- quency is provided in Fig. 15.53. At low frequencies the phase angle 654  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS between VC and E is very small since VC \u0003 E. Recall that if two pha- sors are equal, they must have the same angle. As the applied frequency increases, the network becomes more resistive and the phase angle between VC and E approaches 90°. Keep in mind that, at high frequen- cies, I and E are approaching an in-phase situation and the angle between VC and E will approach that between VC and I, which we know must be 90° (IC leading VC). A plot of VR versus frequency would approach E volts from zero volts with an increase in frequency, but remember VR \u0001 E \u0003 VC due to the vector relationship. The phase angle between I and E could be plot- ted directly from Fig. 15.53 using Eq. (15.15). In Chapter 23, the analysis of this section will be extended to a much wider frequency range using a log axis for frequency. It will be demon- strated that an R-C circuit such as that in Fig. 15.45 can be used as a ﬁl- ter to determine which frequencies will have the greatest impact on the stage to follow. From our current analysis, it is obvious that any net- work connected across the capacitor will receive the greatest potential level at low frequencies and be effectively “shorted out” at very high frequencies. The analysis of a series R-L circuit would proceed in much the same manner, except that XL and VL would increase with frequency and the angle between I and E would approach 90° (voltage leading the cur- rent) rather than 0°. If VL were plotted versus frequency, VL would approach E, and XL would eventually attain a level at which the open- circuit equivalent would be appropriate. 15.6 SUMMARY: SERIES ac CIRCUITS The following is a review of important conclusions that can be derived from the discussion and examples of the previous sections. The list is not all-inclusive, but it does emphasize some of the conclusions that should be carried forward in the future analysis of ac systems. For series ac circuits with reactive elements: 1. The total impedance will be frequency dependent. 2. The impedance of any one element can be greater than the total impedance of the network. 3. The inductive and capacitive reactances are always in direct opposition on an impedance diagram. 4. Depending on the frequency applied, the same circuit can be either predominantly inductive or predominantly capacitive. 5. At lower frequencies the capacitive elements will usually have the most impact on the total impedance, while at high frequencies the inductive elements will usually have the most impact. 6. The magnitude of the voltage across any one element can be greater than the applied voltage. 7. The magnitude of the voltage across an element compared to the other elements of the circuit is directly related to the magnitude of its impedance; that is, the larger the impedance of an element, the larger the magnitude of the voltage across the element. 8. The voltages across a coil or capacitor are always in direct opposition on a phasor diagram. 9. The current is always in phase with the voltage across the resistive elements, lags the voltage across all the inductive a cADMITTANCE AND SUSCEPTANCE  655 elements by 90°, and leads the voltage across all the capacitive elements by 90°. 10. The larger the resistive element of a circuit compared to the net reactive impedance, the closer the power factor is to unity. PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS 15.7 ADMITTANCE AND SUSCEPTANCE The discussion for parallel ac circuits will be very similar to that for dc circuits. In dc circuits, conductance (G) was deﬁned as being equal to 1/R. The total conductance of a parallel circuit was then found by adding the conductance of each branch. The total resistance RT is sim- ply 1/GT. In ac circuits, we deﬁne admittance (Y) as being equal to 1/Z. The unit of measure for admittance as deﬁned by the SI system is siemens, which has the symbol S. Admittance is a measure of how well an ac cir- cuit will admit, or allow, current to ﬂow in the circuit. The larger its value, therefore, the heavier the current ﬂow for the same applied potential. The total admittance of a circuit can also be found by ﬁnding the sum of the parallel admittances. The total impedance ZT of the cir- cuit is then 1/YT; that is, for the network of Fig. 15.54: (15.16)YT \u0001 Y1 \u0005 Y2 \u0005 Y3 \u0005 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \u0005 YN a c Y1 = 1 Z1 Y2 = 1 Z2 Y3 = 1 Z3 YN = 1 ZN YT ZT FIG. 15.54 Parallel ac network. or, since Z \u0001 1/Y, (15.17) For two impedances in parallel, \u0001\u0005 If the manipulations used in Chapter 6 to ﬁnd the total resistance of two parallel resistors are now applied, the following similar equation will result: (15.18)ZT \u0001 \u0002 Z1 Z \u0005 1Z2 Z2 \u0002 1 \u0002 Z2 1 \u0002 Z1 1 \u0002 ZT \u0002 Z 1 T \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 Z 1 1 \u0002 \u0005 \u0002 Z 1 2 \u0002 \u0005 \u0002 Z 1 3 \u0002 \u0005 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ \u0005 \u0002 Z 1 N \u0002 656  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS For three parallel impedances, ZT \u0001 (15.19) As pointed out in the introduction to this section, conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, and (15.20) The reciprocal of reactance (1/X) is called susceptance and is a mea- sure of how susceptible an element is to the passage of current through it. Susceptance is also measured in siemens and is represented by the capital letter B. For the inductor, (15.21) Deﬁning (siemens, S) (15.22) we have (15.23) Note that for inductance, an increase in frequency or inductance will result in a decrease in susceptance or, correspondingly, in admittance. For the capacitor, (15.24) Deﬁning (siemens, S) (15.25) we have (15.26) For the capacitor, therefore, an increase in frequency or capacitance will result in an increase in its susceptibility. For parallel ac circuits, the admittance diagram is used with the three admittances, represented as shown in Fig. 15.55. Note in Fig. 15.55 that the conductance (like resistance) is on the positive real axis, whereas inductive and capacitive susceptances are in direct opposition on the imaginary axis. For any conﬁguration (series, parallel, series-parallel, etc.), the angle associated with the total admittance is the angle by which the source current leads the applied voltage. For inductive networks, vT is negative, whereas for capacitive networks, vT is positive.

The admittance diagram appears in Fig. 15.59. On many occasions, the inverse relationship YT \u0001 1/ZT or ZT \u0001 1/YT will require that we divide the number 1 by a complex number having a real and an imaginary part. This division, if not performed in the polar form, requires that we multiply the numerator and denomina- tor by the conjugate of the denominator, as follows: YT \u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0004\u0005\u0004 \u0005 \u0001 and YT \u0001 S \u0003 j S To avoid this laborious task each time we want to ﬁnd the reciprocal of a complex number in rectangular form, a format can be developed using the following complex number, which is symbolic of any imped- ance or admittance in the ﬁrst or fourth quadrant: \u0001 \u0004\u0005 \u0004\u0005 \u0001 or (15.27) Note that the denominator is simply the sum of the squares of each term. The sign is inverted between the real and imaginary parts. A few examples will develop some familiarity with the use of this equation. \u0002 a1 \u0007 1 jb1 \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 a2 1 a \u0005 1 b2 1 \u0002 \b j \u0002 a2 1 b \u0005 1 b2 1 \u0002 a1 \b j b1\u0002 a2 1 \u0005 b 2 1 a1 \b j b1\u0002 a1 \b j b1 1\u0002 a1 \u0007 jb1 1\u0002 a1 \u0007 jb1 6 \u0002 52 4 \u0002 52 4 \u0003 j 6\u0002 42 \u0005 6 2 (4 \u0004\u0003 j 6 \u0004)\u0002\u0002 (4 \u0004\u0003 j 6 \u0004) 1\u0002\u0002 4 \u0004\u0005 j 6 \u0004 1\u0002\u0002 4 \u0004\u0005 j 6 \u0004 1 \u0002 ZT 800 \u0004\u0002\u0002 170.88 \u0001\u000320.56° 800 \u0004\u0002\u0002 160 \u0003 j 60 800 \u0004\u0002\u0002 160 \u0005 j 40 \u0003 j 100 800 \u0004 \u00010°\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 40 \u000190° \u0005 160 \u00010° \u0005 100 \u0001\u000390° (5 \u0004 \u00010°)(8 \u0004 \u000190°)(20 \u0004 \u0001\u000390°)\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 (5 \u0004 \u00010°)(8 \u0004 \u000190°) \u0005 (8 \u0004 \u000190°)(20 \u0004 \u0001\u000390°) ZRZLZC\u0002\u0002\u0002 ZRZL \u0005 ZLZC \u0005 ZRZC 1\u0002\u0002\u0002 0.2136 S \u0001\u000320.56° 1\u0002 20 \u0004 1 \u0002 XC 1\u0002 8 \u0004 1 \u0002 XL a c 20.56° YR YC YL – YC YT 0.2136 S + YL j FIG. 15.59 Admittance diagram for the network of Fig. 15.58.

The fact that the elements are now in parallel requires that we consider their characteristics in a different manner than occurred for the series R-C circuit of Section 15.5.

FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE PARALLEL R-L NETWORK  669 a c on the total impedance at that frequency. In Fig. 15.80, for example, XL is very small at low frequencies compared to R, establishing XL as the predominant factor in this frequency range. In other words, at low fre- quencies the network will be primarily inductive, and the angle associ- ated with the total impedance will be close to 90°, as with a pure induc- tor. As the frequency increases, XL will increase until it equals the impedance of the resistor (220 \u0005). The frequency at which this situation occurs can be determined in the following manner: XL \u0001 2pf2L \u0001 R and (15.34) which for the network of Fig. 15.79 is f 2 \u0001\u0001 \u0004 8.75 kHz which falls within the frequency range of interest. For frequencies less than f2, XL < R, and for frequencies greater than f2, XL > R, as shown in Fig. 15.80. A general equation for the total impedance in vector form can be developed in the following manner: ZT \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 and ZT \u0001 /90° \u0002tan\u00021 XL /R so that (15.35) and (15.36) The magnitude and angle of the total impedance can now be found at any frequency of interest simply by substituting Eqs.

The result is a network with terminal characteristics that are becoming more and more resistive as the frequency increases, which further conﬁrms the earlier conclusions developed by the curves of Fig. 15.80. Plots of ZT versus frequency in Fig. 15.81 and vT in Fig. 15.82 clearly reveal the transition from an inductive network to one that has resistive characteristics.

The capacitive cir- cuit approaches the level from above, whereas the inductive network does the same from below. For the series R-L circuit and the parallel R-C network, the total impedance will begin at the resistance level and then display the characteristics of the reactive elements at high fre- quencies.

Of course, at this frequency R > XL, and the current IR is relatively small in magni- tude. At f \u0001 40 kHz, the phasor diagram changes to that appearing in Fig. 15.86. Note that now IR and I are close in magnitude and phase because XL > R. The magnitude of IL has dropped to very low levels, and the phase angle associated with IL is approaching \u000290°. The network is now more “resistive” compared to its “inductive” characteristics at low frequencies. The analysis of a parallel R-C or R-L-C network would proceed in much the same manner, with the inductive impedance predominating at low frequencies and the capacitive reactance predominating at high fre- quencies. 15.11 SUMMARY: PARALLEL ac NETWORKS The following is a review of important conclusions that can be derived from the discussion and examples of the previous sections. The list is not all-inclusive, but it does emphasize some of the conclusions that should be carried forward in the future analysis of ac systems. 674  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS a c For parallel ac networks with reactive elements: 1. The total admittance (impedance) will be frequency dependent. 2. The impedance of any one element can be less than the total impedance (recall that for dc circuits the total resistance must always be less than the smallest parallel resistor). 3. The inductive and capacitive susceptances are in direct opposition on an admittance diagram. 4. Depending on the frequency applied, the same network can be either predominantly inductive or predominantly capacitive. 5. At lower frequencies the inductive elements will usually have the most impact on the total impedance, while at high frequencies the capacitive elements will usually have the most impact. 6. The magnitude of the current through any one branch can be greater than the source current. 7. The magnitude of the current through an element, compared to the other elements of the network, is directly related to the magnitude of its impedance; that is, the smaller the impedance of an element, the larger the magnitude of the current through the element. 8. The current through a coil is always in direct opposition with the current through a capacitor on a phasor diagram. 9. The applied voltage is always in phase with the current through the resistive elements, leads the voltage across all the inductive elements by 90°, and lags the current through all capacitive elements by 90°. 10. The smaller the resistive element of a network compared to the net reactive susceptance, the closer the power factor is to unity. 15.12 EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS In a series ac circuit, the total impedance of two or more elements in series is often equivalent to an impedance that can be achieved with fewer elements of different values, the elements and their values being determined by the frequency applied. This is also true for parallel cir- cuits. For the circuit of Fig. 15.87(a), ZT \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 10 \u0005 \u0001\u000290° 50 \u00010°\u0004 5 \u000190° (5 \u0005 \u0001\u000290°)(10 \u0005 \u000190°)\u0004\u0004\u0004 5 \u0005 \u0001\u000290° \u0003 10 \u0005 \u000190° ZCZL\u0004 ZC \u0003 ZL 5 \u0001XC ZT 10 \u0001XL (a) 10 \u0001XC ZT (b) FIG. 15.87 Deﬁning the equivalence between two networks at a speciﬁc frequency.

Always keep in mind that this equivalence is true only at the applied frequency. If the frequency changes, the reactance of each element changes, and the equivalent circuit will change—perhaps from capacitive to inductive in the above example. Another interesting development appears if the impedance of a par- allel circuit, such as the one of Fig. 15.88(a), is found in rectangular form. In this case, ZT \u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001 2.40 \u0005 \u000136.87° \u0001 1.920 \u0005\u0003 j 1.440 \u0005 which is the impedance of a series circuit with a resistor of 1.92 \u0005 and an inductive reactance of 1.44 \u0005, as shown in Fig. 15.88(b). The current I will be the same in each circuit of Fig. 15.87 or Fig. 15.88 if the same input voltage E is applied. For a parallel circuit of one resistive element and one reactive element, the series circuit with the same input impedance will always be composed of one resistive and one reactive element. The impedance of each element of the series cir- cuit will be different from that of the parallel circuit, but the reactive elements will always be of the same type; that is, an R-L circuit and an R-C parallel circuit will have an equivalent R-L and R-C series circuit, respectively. The same is true when converting from a series to a paral- lel circuit. In the discussion to follow, keep in mind that the term equivalent refers only to the fact that for the same applied potential, the same impedance and input current will result. To formulate the equivalence between the series and parallel circuits, the equivalent series circuit for a resistor and reactance in parallel can be found by determining the total impedance of the circuit in rectangu- lar form; that is, for the circuit of Fig. 15.89(a), Yp \u0001\u0003 \u0001 \u0007 j and Zp \u0001\u0001 \u0001\b j Multiplying the numerator and denominator of each term by R2 p X2 p results in Zp \u0001\b j \u0001 Rs \b j Xs [Fig. 15.89(b)] and (15.39)Rs \u0001 \u0004 X R 2 p p \u0003 X R 2 p 2 p \u0004 R2 p Xp\u0004 X2 p \u0003 R2 p Rp X2 p\u0004 X2 p \u0003 R2 p 1/Xp\u0004\u0004 (1/Rp) 2 \u0003 (1/Xp) 2 1/Rp\u0004\u0004 (1/Rp) 2 \u0003 (1/Xp) 2 1\u0004\u0004 (1/Rp) \u0007 j (1/Xp) 1 \u0004 Yp 1 \u0004 Xp 1 \u0004 RP 1\u0004 \bj Xp 1 \u0004 Rp 12 \u000190°\u0004\u0004 5 \u000153.13° (4 \u0005 \u000190°)(3 \u0005 \u00010°)\u0004\u0004\u0004 4 \u0005 \u000190° \u0003 3 \u0005 \u00010° ZLZR\u0004 ZL \u0003 ZR 4 \u0001 R 3 \u0001XL I ZT E + – (a) XL = 1.44 \u0001I ZT E + – (b) R = 1.92 \u0001 FIG. 15.88 Finding the series equivalent circuit for a parallel R-L network.

Phase-shift measure- ments can also be performed using a single-trace oscilloscope by properly interpreting the resulting Lissajous patterns obtained on the screen. This latter approach, however, will be left for the laboratory experience. In Fig. 15.97, channel 1 of the dual-trace oscilloscope is hooked up to display the applied voltage e. Channel 2 is connected to display the voltage across the inductor vL. Of particular importance is the fact that the ground of the scope is connected to the ground of the oscilloscope for both channels. In other words, there is only one common ground for the circuit and oscilloscope. The resulting waveforms may appear as shown in Fig. 15.98. 1\u0004 6.675 \u0005 1\u0004 8 \u0005 FIG. 15.95 Series equivalent circuit for the parallel R-L-C network of Fig. 15.92 with q \u0001 1000 rad/s.

Points a and b have a common ground that will establish a zero-volt drop between the two points; this drop will have the same effect as a short-circuit con- nection between a and b. The resulting short circuit will “short out” the inductive element, and the current will increase due to the drop in impedance for the circuit.

The current, controlled solely by the resistance R, could jump to dangerous levels and damage the equipment. The phase relationship between e and vR can be determined by sim- ply interchanging the positions of the coil and resistor or by introduc- ing a sensing resistor, as shown in Fig. 15.100. A sensing resistor is exactly that: introduced to “sense” a quantity without adversely affect- ing the behavior of the network. In other words, the sensing resistor must be small enough compared to the other impedances of the network not to cause a signiﬁcant change in the voltage and current levels or phase relationships. Note that the sensing resistor is introduced in a way that will result in one end being connected to the common ground of the network. In Fig. 15.100, channel 2 will display the voltage vRs, which is in phase with the current i. However, the current i is also in phase with the voltage vR across the resistor R. The net result is that the voltages vRs and vR are in phase and the phase relationship between e and vR can be determined from the waveforms e and vRs. Since vRs and i are in phase, the above procedure will also determine the phase angle between the applied voltage e and the source current i. If the magnitude of Rs is sufﬁciently small compared to R or XL, the phase measurements of Fig. 15.97 can be performed with Rs in place. That is, channel 2 can be con- nected to the top of the inductor and to ground, and the effect of Rs can be ignored. In the above application, the sensing resistor will not reveal the magnitude of the voltage vR but simply the phase relationship between e and vR.

Channel 1 will display the voltage vR, and channel 2 will display the voltage vRs. Since vR is in phase with iR, and vRs is in phase with the current iL, the phase rela- tionship between vR and vRs will be the same as that between iR and iL. In this case, the magnitudes of the current levels can be determined using Ohm’s law and the resistance levels R and Rs, respectively.

If the phase relationship between e and is of Fig. 15.101 is required, a sensing resistor can be employed, as shown in Fig. 15.102. In general, therefore, for dual-trace measurements of phase relation- ships, be particularly careful of the grounding arrangement, and fully utilize the in-phase relationship between the voltage and current of a resistor. 15.14 APPLICATIONS Home Wiring An expanded view of house wiring is provided in Fig. 15.103 to permit a discussion of the entire system. The house panel has been included with the “feed” and the important grounding mechanism. In addition, a APPLICATIONS  683 a c number of typical circuits found in the home have been included to pro- vide a sense for the manner in which the total power is distributed. First note how the copper bars in the panel are laid out to provide both 120 V and 208 V. Between any one bar and ground is the single- phase 120-V supply. However, the bars have been arranged so that 208 V can be obtained between two vertical adjacent bars using a double-gang circuit breaker. When time permits, examine your own panel (but do not remove the cover), and note the dual circuit breaker arrangement for the 208-V supply. For appliances such as ﬁxtures and heaters that have a metal casing, the ground wire is connected to the metal casing to provide a direct path to ground path for a “shorting” or errant current as described in Section 7.7. For outlets and such that do not have a conductive casing, the ground lead is connected to a point on the outlet that distributes to all important points of the outlet. Note the series arrangement between the thermostat and the heater but the parallel arrangement between heaters on the same circuit. In addition, note the series connection of switches to lights in the upper- right corner but the parallel connection of lights and outlets. Due to high current demand the air conditioner, heaters, and electric stove have 30-A breakers.

Speaker Systems The best reproduction of sound is obtained using a different speaker for the low-, mid-, and high-frequency regions. Although the typical audio range for the human ear is from about 100 Hz to 20 kHz, speakers are available from 20 Hz to 40 kHz. For the low-frequency range usually extending from about 20 Hz to 300 Hz, a speaker referred to as a woofer is used. Of the three speakers, it is normally the largest. The mid-range speaker is typically smaller in size and covers the range from about 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The tweeter, as it is normally called, is usually the smallest of the three speakers and typically covers the range from about 2 kHz to 25 kHz. There is an overlap of frequencies to ensure that frequencies aren’t lost in those regions where the response of one drops off and the other takes over. A great deal more about the range of each speaker and their dB response (a term you may have heard when dis- cussing speaker response) will be covered in detail in Chapter 23. One popular method for hooking up the three speakers is the cross- over conﬁguration of Fig. 15.104. Note that it is nothing more than a parallel network with a speaker in each branch and full applied voltage across each branch. The added elements (inductors and capacitors) were carefully chosen to set the range of response for each speaker. Note that each speaker is labeled with an impedance level and associ- ated frequency. This type of information is typical when purchasing a quality speaker. It immediately identiﬁes the type of speaker and reveals at which frequency it will have its maximum response. A detailed analysis of the same network will be included in Section 23.15. For now, however, it should prove interesting to determine the total imped- ance of each branch at speciﬁc frequencies to see if indeed the response of one will far outweigh the response of the other two. Since an ampli- ﬁer with an output impedance of 8 \u0005 is to be employed, maximum 8 \u0001 Llow = 3.3 mH Vi + – 8 \u0001 8 \u0001 Cmid = 47 F\u0005 Lmid = 270 H\u0005 Chigh = 3.9 F\u0005 Woofer Tweeter Midrange FIG. 15.104 Crossover speaker system. APPLICATIONS  685 a c transfer of power (see Section 18.5 for ac networks) to the speaker will result when the impedance of the branch is equal to or very close to 8 \u0005. Let us begin by examining the response of the frequencies to be car- ried primarily by the mid-range speaker since it represents the greatest portion of the human hearing range. Since the mid-range speaker branch is rated at 8 \u0005 at 1.4 kHz, let us test the effect of applying 1.4 kHz to all branches of the crossover network. For the mid-range speaker: XC \u0001 \u0004 2p 1 fC \u0004 \u0001\u0001 2.42 \u0005 XL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2p(1.4 kHz)(270 mH) \u0001 2.78 \u0005 R \u0001 8 \u0005 and Zmid-range \u0001 R \u0003 j (XL \u0002 XC) \u0001 8 \u0005\u0003 j (2.78 \u0005 \u0002 2.42 \u0005) \u0001 8 \u0005 \u0003 j 0.36 \u0005 \u0001 8.008 \u0005 \u0001\u00022.58° \u0003 8 \u0005 \u00010° \u0001 R In Fig. 15.105(a), the ampliﬁer with the output impedance of 8 \u0005 has been applied across the mid-range speaker at a frequency of 1.4 kHz. Since the total reactance offered by the two series reactive ele- ments is so small compared to the 8-\u0005 resistance of the speaker, we can essentially replace the series combination of the coil and capacitor by a short circuit of 0 \u0005. We are then left with a situation where the load impedance is an exact match with the output impedance of the ampli- ﬁer, and maximum power will be delivered to the speaker. Because of the equal series impedances, each will capture half the applied voltage or 6 V. The power to the speaker is then V 2/R \u0001 (6 V)2/8 \u0005 \u0001 4.5 W. At a frequency of 1.4 kHz we would expect the woofer and tweeter to have minimum impact on the generated sound. We will now test the validity of this statement by determining the impedance of each branch at 1.4 kHz. For the woofer: XL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2p(1.4 kHz)(3.3 mH) \u0001 29.03 \u0005 and Zwoofer \u0001 R \u0003 jXL \u0001 8 \u0005\u0003 j 29.03 \u0005 \u0001 30.11 \u0005 \u000174.59° which is a poor match with the output impedance of the ampliﬁer.

APPLICATIONS  687 a c Consequently, the sound generated by the mid-range speaker will far outweigh the response of the tweeter also. All in all, the mid-range speaker predominates at a frequency of 1.4 kHz for the crossover network of Fig. 15.104. Just for interest sake, let us now determine the impedance of the tweeter at 20 kHz and the impact of the woofer at this frequency. For the tweeter: XC \u0001\u0001 \u0001 2.04 \u0005 with Ztweeter \u0001 8 \u0005\u0002 j 2.04 \u0005\u0001 8.26 \u0005 \u0001\u000214.31° Even though the magnitude of the impedance of the branch is not exactly 8 \u0005, it is very close, and the speaker will receive a high level of power (actually 4.43 W). For the woofer: XL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2p(20 kHz)(3.3 mH) \u0001 414.69 \u0005 with Zwoofer \u0001 8 \u0005\u0002 j 414.69 \u0005\u0001 414.77 \u0005 \u000188.9° which is a terrible match with the output impedance of the ampliﬁer. Therefore, the speaker will receive a very low level of power (6.69 mW \u0003 0.007 W). For all the calculations, note that the capacitive elements predomi- nate at low frequencies, and the inductive elements at high frequen- cies. For the low frequencies, the reactance of the coil will be quite small, permitting a full transfer of power to the speaker. For the high- frequency tweeter, the reactance of the capacitor is quite small, pro- viding a direct path for power ﬂow to the speaker. Phase-Shift Power Control In Chapter 12 the internal structure of a light dimmer was examined and its basic operation described. We can now turn our attention to how the power ﬂow to the bulb is controlled. If the dimmer were composed of simply resistive elements, all the voltages of the network would be in phase as shown in Fig. 15.106(a). If we assume that 20 V are required to turn on the triac of Fig. 12.49, then the power will be distributed to the bulb for the period highlighted by the blue area of Fig. 15.106(a). For this situation, the bulb is close to full brightness since the applied voltage is available to the bulb for almost the entire cycle. To reduce the power to the bulb (and therefore reduce its brightness), the controlling voltage would have to have a lower peak voltage as shown in Fig. 15.106(b). In fact, the waveform of Fig. 15.106(b) is such that the turn-on voltage is not reached until the peak value occurs. In this case power is delivered to the bulb for only half the cycle, and the brightness of the bulb will be reduced. The prob- lem with using only resistive elements in a dimmer now becomes apparent: The bulb can be made no dimmer than the situation depicted by Fig. 15.106(b). Any further reduction in the controlling voltage would reduce its peak value below the trigger level, and the bulb would never turn on. This dilemma can be resolved by using a series combination of ele- ments such as shown in Fig. 15.107(a) from the dimmer of Fig. 12.49. Note that the controlling voltage is the voltage across the capacitor, 1\u0004\u0004\u0004 2p(20 kHz)(3.9 mF) 1\u0004 2pfC 170 20 0 V (volts) t Applied voltage (b) Controlling voltage (a) 170 20 0 V (volts) t Applied voltage Lamp voltage FIG. 15.106 Light dimmer: (a) with purely resistive elements; (b) half-cycle power distribution. 688  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS a c while the full line voltage of 120 V rms, 170 V peak, is across the entire branch. To describe the behavior of the network, let us examine the case deﬁned by setting the potentiometer (used as a rheostat) to 1/10 its maximum value, or 33 k\u0005. Combining the 33 k\u0005 with the ﬁxed resis- tance of 47 k\u0005 will result in a total resistance of 80 k\u0005 and the equiv- alent network of Fig. 15.107(b). At 60 Hz, the reactance of the capacitor is XC \u0001 \u0004 2p 1 fC \u0004 \u0001\u0001 42.78 k\u0005 Applying the voltage divider rule: Vcontrol \u0001 \u0004 ZR Z \u0003 CV Z s C \u0004 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 0.472Vs \u0001\u000261.86° Using a peak value of 170 V: Vcontrol \u0001 0.472(170 V) \u0001\u000261.86° \u0001 80.24 V \u0001\u000261.86° producing the waveform of Fig. 15.108(a). The result is a waveform with a phase shift of 61.86° (lagging the applied line voltage) and a rel- atively high peak value. The high peak value will result in a quick tran- sition to the 20-V turn-on level, and power will be distributed to the bulb for the major portion of the applied signal. Recall from the dis- cussion of Chapter 12 that the response in the negative region is a replica of that achieved in the positive region. If we reduced the poten- tiometer resistance further, the phase angle would be reduced, and the bulb would burn brighter. The situation is now very similar to that described for the response of Fig. 15.106(a). In other words, nothing has been gained thus far by using the capacitive element in the control network. However, let us now increase the potentiometer resistance to 200 k\u0005 and note the effect on the controlling voltage. 42.78 k\u0005 Vs \u0001\u000290°\u0004\u0004\u0004 90.72 k\u0005 \u0001\u000228.14° (42.78 k\u0005 \u0001\u000290°)(Vs \u00010°)\u0004\u0004\u0004 80 k\u0005\u0002 j 42.78 k\u0005 1\u0004\u0004 2p(60 Hz)(62 mF) + – G K A TRIACDIAC 0.068 µFVcontrol 330-k\u0001 rheostat 47 k\u0001 + – Vline = 170 V ∠0° (peak) (a) + – 170 V ∠0° 0.068 µFC (b) Vcontrol + – 80 k\u0001R FIG. 15.107 Light dimmer: (a) from Fig. 12.49; (b) with rheostat set at 33 k\u0001.

The result, as depicted by Fig. 15.108(b), is that the ﬁring potential of 20 V is not reached until near the end of the positive region of the applied voltage. Power is delivered to the bulb for only a very short period of time, causing the bulb to be quite dim, signiﬁcantly dimmer than obtained from the response of Fig. 15.106(b). A conduction angle less than 90° is therefore possible due only to the phase shift introduced by the series R-C combination. Thus, it is possible to construct a network of some signiﬁcance with a rather sim- ple pair of elements. 15.15 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Series R-L-C Circuit The R-L-C network of Fig. 15.35 will now be analyzed using OrCAD Capture.

The Simulation Settings dialog will now appear, and since we are continuing to plot the results against time, the Time Domain(Tran- sient) option is selected under Analysis type. Since the period of each cycle of the applied source is 1 ms, the Run to time will be set at 5 ms so that ﬁve cycles will appear. The Start saving data after will be left at 0 s even though there will be an oscillatory period for the reactive elements before the circuit settles down.

The result will be a blank screen with an x-axis extending from 0 s to 5 ms. The ﬁrst quantity of interest is the current through the circuit, so Trace-Add-Trace is selected followed by I(R) and OK. The resulting plot of Fig. 15.110 clearly shows that there is a period of storing and discharging of the reactive elements before a steady-state level is estab- lished. It would appear that after 3 ms, steady-state conditions have been essentially established. Select the Toggle cursor key, and left- click the mouse; a cursor will result that can be moved along the axis near the maximum value around 1.4 ms. In fact, the cursor reveals a maximum value of 16.4 A which exceeds the steady-state solution by over 2 A. A right click of the mouse will establish a second cursor on the screen that can be placed near the steady-state peak around 4.4 ms. The resulting peak value is about 14.15 A which is a match with the longhand solution for Fig. 15.35. We will therefore assume that steady- state conditions have been established for the circuit after 4 ms. FIG. 15.110 A plot of the current for the circuit of Fig. 15.109 showing the transition from the transient state to the steady-state response. Let us now add the source voltage through Trace-Add Trace- V(Vs:+)-OK to obtain the multiple plot at the bottom of Fig. 15.111. Forthe voltage across the coil, the sequence Plot-Add Plot to Window- Trace-Add Trace-V(L:1)-V(L:2) will result in the plot appearing at the top of Fig. 15.111. Take special note of the fact that the Trace Expression is V(L:1)\u0001V(L:2) rather than just V(L:1) because V(L:1) would be the voltage from that point to ground which would include the voltage across the capacitor. In addition, the \u0001 sign between the two comes from the Functions or Macros list at right of the Add Traces 692  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS a c dialog box. Finally, since we know that the waveforms are fairly steady after 3 ms, let us cut away the waveforms before 3 ms with Plot-Axis Settings-X axis-User Deﬁned-3ms to 5ms-OK to obtain the two cycles of Fig. 15.111. Now you can clearly see that the peak value of the voltage across the coil is 100 V to match the analysis of Fig. 15.35. It is also clear that the applied voltage leads the input current by an angle that can be determined using the cursors. First activate the cursor option by selecting the cursor key (a red plot through the origin) in the second toolbar down from the menu bar. Then select V(Vs:+) at the bottom left of the screen with a left click of the mouse, and set it at that point where the applied voltage passes through the horizontal axis with a positive slope. The result is A1 \u0001 4 ms at \u00024.243 mV \u0003 0 V. Then select I(R) at the bottom left of the screen with a right click of the mouse, and place it at the point where the current waveform passes through the horizontal axis with a positive slope. The result is A2 \u0001 4.15 ms at \u000255.15 mA \u0001 0.55 A \u0003 0 A (compared to a peak value of 14.14 A). At the bottom of the Probe Cursor dialog box, the time dif- ference is 147.24 ms. Now set up the ratio \u0001 v \u0001 52.99° The phase angle by which the applied voltage leads the source is 52.99° which is very close to the theoretical solution of 53.13° obtained in Fig. 15.39.

COMPUTER ANALYSIS  693 a c Electronics Workbench We will now examine the response of a network versus frequency rather than time using the network of Fig. 15.79 which now appears on the schematic of Fig. 15.112. The ac current source appears as AC–CUR- RENT–SOURCE in the Sources tool bin next to the ac voltage source. Note that the current source was given an amplitude of 1 A to establish a magnitude match between the response of the voltage across the net- work and the impedance of the network. That is, \u0007 ZT \u0007 \u0001 \u0007\u0007 \u0001 \u0007\u0007 \u0001 \u0007 Vs \u0007 Before applying computer methods, we should develop a rough idea of what to expect so that we have something to which to compare the computer solution. At very high frequencies such as 1 MHz, the imped- ance of the inductive element will be about 25 k\u0005 which when placed in parallel with the 220 \u0005 will look like an open circuit. The result is that as the frequency gets very high, we should expect the impedance of the network to approach the 220-\u0005 level of the resistor. In addition, since the network will take on resistive characteristics at very high fre- quencies, the angle associated with the input impedance should also approach 0 \u0005. At very low frequencies the reactance of the inductive element will be much less than the 220 \u0005 of the resistor, and the net- work will take on inductive characteristics. In fact, at, say, 10 Hz, the reactance of the inductor is only about 0.25 \u0005 which is very close to a short-circuit equivalent compared to the parallel 220-\u0005 resistor. The result is that the impedance of the network is very close to 0 \u0005 at very low frequencies. Again, since the inductive effects are so strong at low Vs\u0004 1 A Vs\u0004 Is FIG. 15.112 Obtaining an impedance plot for a parallel R-L network using Electronics Workbench. 694  SERIES AND PARALLEL ac CIRCUITS a c frequencies, the phase angle associated with the input impedance should be very close to 90°. Now for the computer analysis. The current source, the resistor ele- ment, and the inductor are all placed and connected using procedures described in detail in earlier chapters. However, there is one big differ- ence this time that the user must be aware of: Since the output will be plotted versus frequency, the Analysis Setup heading must be selected in the AC Current dialog box for the current source. When selected, the AC Magnitude must be set to the value of the ac source. In this case, the default level of 1A matches that of the applied source, so we were set even if we failed to check the setting. In the future, however, a voltage or current source may be used that does not have an amplitude of 1, and proper entries must be made to this listing. For the simulation the sequence Simulate-Analyses-AC Analysis is ﬁrst applied to obtain the AC Analysis dialog box. The Start fre- quency will be set at 10 Hz so that we have entries at very low fre- quencies, and the Stop frequency will be set at 1MHz so that we have data points at the other end of the spectrum. The Sweep type can remain Decade, but the number of points per decade will be 1000 so that we obtain a detailed plot. The Vertical scale will be set on Linear. Within Output variables we ﬁnd that only one node, 1, is deﬁned. Shifting it over to the Selected variables for analysis column using the Plot during simulation key pad and then hitting the Simulate key will result in the two plots of Fig. 15.112. The Show/Hide Grid key was selected to place the grid on the graph, and the Show/Hide Cursors key was selected to place the AC Analysis dialog box appearing in Fig. 15.112. Since two graphs are present, we must deﬁne the one we are working on by clicking on the Voltage or Phase heading on the left side of each plot. A small red arrow will appear when selected to keep us aware of the active plot. When setting up the cursors, be sure that you have activated the correct plot. When the red cursor is moved to 10 Hz (x1), we ﬁnd that the voltage across the network is only 0.251 V (y1), resulting in an input impedance of only 0.25 \u0005—quite small and matching our theoretical prediction. In addition, note that the phase angle is essentially at 90° in the other plot, conﬁrming our other assumption above—a totally inductive network. If we set the blue cur- sor near 100 kHz (x2 \u0001 102.3 kHz), we ﬁnd that the impedance at 219.2 \u0005 (y2) is closing in on the resistance of the parallel resistor of 220 \u0005, again conﬁrming the preliminary analysis above. As noted in the bottom of the AC Analysis box, the maximum value of the voltage is 219.99 \u0005 or essentially 220 \u0005 at 1 MHz. Before leaving the plot, note the advantages of using a log axis when you want a response over a wide frequency range. PROBLEMS  695 PROBLEMS SECTION 15.2 Impedance and the Phasor Diagram 1.

A brief review of Chapter 7 may be helpful before considering these networks since the approach here will be quite similar to that undertaken earlier. The circuits to be discussed will have only one source of energy, either potential or current. Networks with two or more sources will be considered in Chapters 17 and 18, using methods previ- ously described for dc circuits. In general, when working with series-parallel ac networks, consider the following approach: 1. Redraw the network, employing block impedances to combine obvious series and parallel elements, which will reduce the network to one that clearly reveals the fundamental structure of the system. 2. Study the problem and make a brief mental sketch of the overall approach you plan to use. Doing this may result in time- and energy-saving shortcuts. In some cases a lengthy, drawn-out analysis may not be necessary. A single application of a fundamental law of circuit analysis may result in the desired solution. 3. After the overall approach has been determined, it is usually best to consider each branch involved in your method independently before tying them together in series-parallel combinations. In most cases, work back from the obvious series and parallel combi- nations to the source to determine the total impedance of the network. The source current can then be determined, and the path back to speciﬁc unknowns can be deﬁned. As you progress back to the source, continually deﬁne those unknowns that have not been lost in the reduction process. It will save time when you have to work back through the network to ﬁnd speciﬁc quantities. Series-Parallel ac Networks 710  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS 4. When you have arrived at a solution, check to see that it is reasonable by considering the magnitudes of the energy source and the elements in the circuit. If not, either solve the network using another approach, or check over your work very carefully. At this point a computer solution can be an invaluable asset in the validation process. 16.2 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 16.1 For the network of Fig. 16.1: a. Calculate ZT. b. Determine Is. c. Calculate VR and VC. d. Find IC. e. Compute the power delivered. f. Find Fp of the network. Solutions: a. As suggested in the introduction, the network has been redrawn with block impedances, as shown in Fig. 16.2. The impedance Z1 is simply the resistor R of 1 \u0001, and Z2 is the parallel combination of XC and XL. The network now clearly reveals that it is funda- mentally a series circuit, suggesting a direct path toward the total impedance and the source current. As noted in the introduction, for many such problems you must work back to the source to ﬁnd ﬁrst the total impedance and then the source current. When the unknown quantities are found in terms of these subscripted imped- ances, the numerical values can then be substituted to ﬁnd the magnitude and phase angle of the unknown. In other words, try to ﬁnd the desired solution solely in terms of the subscripted imped- ances before substituting numbers. This approach will usually enhance the clarity of the chosen path toward a solution while saving time and preventing careless calculation errors. Note also in Fig. 16.2 that all the unknown quantities except IC have been preserved, meaning that we can use Fig. 16.2 to determine these quantities rather than having to return to the more complex net- work of Fig. 16.1.

The fact that the net- work is capacitive can be determined from the original network by ﬁrst realizing that, for the parallel L-C elements, the smaller impedance pre- dominates and results in an R-C network.

The transistor equivalent circuit includes a current source I and an output impedance Ro. The resistor RC is a biasing resistor to establish speciﬁc dc conditions, and the resistor Ri represents the loading of the next stage. The coupling capacitor is designed to be an open circuit for dc and to have as low an impedance as possible for the frequencies of interest to ensure that VL is a maximum value. The frequency range of the example includes the entire audio (hearing) spectrum from 100 Hz to 20 kHz. The pur- pose of the example is to demonstrate that, for the full audio range, the effect of the capacitor can be ignored. It performs its function as a dc blocking agent but permits the ac to pass through with little distur- bance. 300 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 5 \u000153.13° (3 \u0001 \u00010°)(100 V \u00010°)\u0005\u0005\u0005 3 \u0001 \u00010° \u0003 4 \u0001 \u000190° 100 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 10 \u0001 \u0001\u000436.87° E \u0005 Z2 100 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 5 \u0001 \u000153.13° E \u0005 Z1 100 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 4.472 \u0001 \u000126.56° E \u0005 ZT 50 \u0001 \u000116.26°\u0005\u0005 11.18 \u0001\u000410.30° 50 \u0001 \u000116.26°\u0005\u0005 11 \u0004 j 2 (5 \u0001 \u000153.13°)(10 \u0001 \u0001\u000436.87°)\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005 (3 \u0001\u0003 j 4 \u0001) \u0003 (8 \u0001\u0004 j 6 \u0001) Z1Z2\u0005 Z1 \u0003 Z2 I1 I2 Z2Z1 I YT + – E = 100 V ∠ 0° FIG. 16.8 Network of Fig. 16.7 after assigning the block impedances. 3 \u0001 Vaba b VR2 8 \u0001 + – VR1 + – + – FIG. 16.9 Determining the voltage Vab for the network of Fig. 16.7. 714  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS a.

Remember that the j must follow the numerical value of the imaginary part and is not multiplied by the numerical value. Simply type in the numerical value and then j. Also recall that unless you make a global change in the format, an i will appear with the imag- inary part of the solution. As shown in Fig. 16.18, each impedance is ﬁrst deﬁned with Shift:. Then each impedance is entered in sequence on the same line or succeeding lines. Next, the equation for the total impedance is deﬁned using the brackets to ensure that the bottom sum- mation is carried out before the division and also to provide the same format to the equation as appearing above. Then enter ZT, select the equal sign key, and the rectangular form for the total impedance will appear as shown. The polar form can be obtained by ﬁrst going to the Calculator toolbar to obtain the magnitude operation and inserting ZT as shown in Fig. 16.18. Then selecting the equal sign will result in the magnitude of 10.693 \u0001. The angle is obtained by ﬁrst going to the Greek toolbar and picking up theta, entering T, and deﬁning the variable.

The following are simply two more that include series-parallel combinations of elements and systems to perform important everyday tasks. The ground fault interrupter (GFI) outlet employs series protective switches and sensing coils and a paral- lel control system, while the ideal equivalent circuit for the coax cable employs a series-parallel combination of inductors and capacitors. GFI (Ground Fault Interrupter) The National Electric Code, the “bible” for all electrical contractors, now requires that ground fault interrupter (GFI) outlets be used in any area where water and dampness could result in serious injury, such as in bathrooms, pools, marinas, and so on. The outlet looks like any other except that it has a reset button and a test button in the center of the unit as shown in Fig. 16.21(a). Its primary difference between an ordinary outlet is that it will shut the power off much more quickly than the breaker all the way down in the basement could. You may still feel a shock with a GFI outlet, but the current will cut off so quickly (in a few milliseconds) that a person in normal health should not receive a seri- ous electrical injury. Whenever in doubt about its use, remember that the cost is such that it should be installed. It works just as a regular out- let does, but it provides an increased measure of safety. The basic operation is best described by the simple network of Fig. 16.21(b). The protection circuit separates the power source from the outlet itself. Note in Fig. 16.21(b) the importance of grounding the pro- tection circuit to the central ground of the establishment (a water pipe, ground bar, and so on, connected to the main panel). In general, the out- let will be grounded to the same connection. Basically, the network shown in Fig. 16.21(b) senses both the current entering (Ii) and the cur- rent leaving (Io) and provides a direct connection to the outlet when they are equal. If a fault should develop such as caused by someone touching the hot leg while standing on a wet ﬂoor, the return current will be less than the feed current (just a few milliamperes is enough). The protection circuitry will sense this difference, establish an open cir- cuit in the line, and cut off the power to the outlet. In Fig. 16.22(a) you can see the feed and return lines passing through the sensing coils. The two sensing coils are separately con- nected to the printed circuit board. There are two pulse control switches in the line and a return to establish an open circuit under errant condi- 722  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS tions. The two contacts in Fig. 16.22(a) are the contacts that provide conduction to the outlet. When a fault develops, another set of similar contacts in the housing will slide away, providing the desired open- circuit condition. The separation is created by the solenoid appearing in Fig. 16.22(b). When the solenoid is energized due to a fault condi- tion, it will pull the plunger toward the solenoid, compressing the spring. At the same time, the slots in the lower plastic piece (connected directly to the plunger) will shift down, causing a disconnect by mov- ing the structure inserted in the slots. The test button is connected to the brass bar across the unit in Fig. 16.22(c) below the reset button. When pressed, it will place a large resistor between the line and ground to “unbalance” the line and cause a fault condition. When the button is released, the resistor will be separated from the line, and the unbalance condition will be removed. The resistor is actually connected directly to one end of the bar and moves down with pressure on the bar as shown in Fig. 16.22(d). Note in Fig. 16.22(c) how the metal ground connection passes right through the entire unit and how it is connected to the ground terminal of an applied plug. Also note how it is separated from the rest of the network with the plastic housing.

Before leaving the subject, note the logic chip in the center of Fig. 16.22(a) and the various sizes of capacitors and resistors. Note also the four diodes in the upper left region of the circuit board used as a bridge rectiﬁer for the ac-to-dc conversion process. The transistor is the black element with the half-circle appearance. It is part of the driver circuit for the controlling solenoid. Because of the size of the unit, there wasn’t a lot of room to provide the power to quickly open the circuit. The result is the use of a pulse circuit to control the motion of the controlling solenoid. In other words, the solenoid is pulsed for a short period of time to cause the required release. If the design used a system that would hold the circuit open on a continuing basis, the power requirement would be greater and the size of the coil larger. A small coil can handle the required power pulse for a short period of time without any long-term damage. As mentioned earlier, if unsure, then install a GFI. It provides a mea- sure of safety—at a very reasonable cost—that should not be ignored. Coax Cable In recent years it appears that coax cable is everywhere, from TV con- nections to medical equipment, from stereos to computer connections. What makes this type of connection so special? What are its advantages over the standard two-wire connection? The primary purpose of coax cable is to provide a channel for com- munication between two points without picking up noise from the sur- rounding medium—a direct link in its purest form. You may wonder whether noise pollution is really that bad and whether this concern is overkill, but simply think of all the signals passing through the air that we cannot see, for example, for cellular phones, pagers, and radio and TV stations. Then you start to realize that there is a lot going on out there that we can’t see. None of us would like our EKG signal from our heart to be disturbed by extraneous noise or to have our stereo pick up channels other than those of interest. It is a real problem that must be solved, and it appears that the best solution is to use coax cable. Compared to stan- dard conductors, coax displays a lower loss of signal in transmission and has much improved high-frequency transmission characteristics. It is the construction that offers the protection we desire. The basic construction of a 75-\u0001 coax cable as typically used in the home appears in Fig. 16.23(a) with its terminal connection in Fig. 16.23(b). It has a FIG. 16.23 75-\u0001 coax cable: (a) construction; (b) terminal connection. \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0003\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0007\b \t\u0001\u0006 \u000b\f\u000b\r\r\u000e \u000f\u0001\b\u0010 \u0006\u0003\r\u0004\u0011 \u0006\u0012\u0011\u0004 \u0013 \u0014\u0015 \u0017˘ˇ ˆ˙\r\u000e\r\u0007\u0004 \u0005\u0012\u0007 \u0004˝ \u0017\u0004˙˛\u0007\u0013˙˛ ˚\u000b\u0001\u0007˝ \u0000˚\u0002 APPLICATIONS  725 solid inner conductor surrounded by a polyethylene dielectric (insula- tor). Copper or aluminum braid woven over the dielectric forms the outer conductor. Finally, a waterproof jacket placed over the braided wire provides protection against moisture. Since the entire outer surface of the braided wire is at the same potential, it completely isolates the solid conductor in the center of the coax cable from the outside sig- nals—an isolation referred to as shielding. The question is sometimes asked, Why is the outside wire braided rather than just a ﬂat sheet of conducting material? It is braided to reduce the effects of the ﬁelds established by any currents that pass through the outside conductor. In Fig. 16.24(a), a current in the outer conductor has established circular magnetic ﬁelds that can be additive and can create transmission prob- lems. However, as shown in Fig. 16.24(b), if the wire is braided, the magnetic ﬁeld established by one wire in the braid may be canceled by a neighboring conductor crossing the conductor on an angle. Note the opposite direction of the ﬁelds in the region between the two braided wires. Of course, the total magnetic ﬂux may not be canceled, but the situation is certainly improved compared to that with a solid ﬂat con- ductor. For added protection, a duofoil covering is sometimes added as shown in Fig. 16.23(a) to ensure 100% shielding. Because a coax cable is most commonly referred to as an RF (radio- frequency) transmission line, most people associate the use of coax cables with high frequencies. However, this is certainly not the case, as evidenced by medical technology that deals with static dc levels and low-voltage (in microvolts or millivolts), “slow” (less than 5 Hz) ac. In general, coax cables should be used wherever there is a need to ensure that the transmitted signal is undisturbed by any surrounding noise. Coax cables are acceptable for the full range of frequencies from 0 Hz to a few hundred gigahertz, with sound frequencies extending from about 15 Hz to 20 kHz, radio frequencies from 20 kHz to 300 MHz, and microwave frequencies from 300 MHz to 300 GHz. Our discussion thus far has centered on protecting the transmitted signal from external noise. It is important to realize also that when a coax cable is used, it will not act as a transmitter for the signal that it is carrying. This fact is very important as we hook up electronic appliances such as VCRs to our TVs. If we simply used a twin lead wire between the VCR and TV, not only would the wire pick up signals by acting like an antenna, but it would also transmit channel 3 (or 4) to the surrounding medium FIG. 16.24 Shielding: (a) solid outside inductor; (b) braided outside conductor.

For the coupling between the systems in which coax cable is typi- cally used, it is not the level of voltage or current that is the primary concern but whether there is a good “match” between components and the cable. Every transmission line composed of two parallel conductors will have capacitance between the conductors, and every conductor that is carrying current has a certain level of inductance. For a transmission line an equivalent model can be composed of the lumped series-parallel combination of Fig. 16.25(a), where each capacitor or inductor is for a short length of the wire. For an inﬁnitely long chain of the elements of Fig. 16.25(a), the combination has an input impedance called the char- acteristic impedance that is proportional to \u0001L\u0002/C\u0002 where L and C are the inductance and capacitance of a unit length of the transmission line. Although Figure 16.25(a) suggests that a transmission line is purely reactive, there is resistance in the line because of the resistance of the wire, and this resistance will absorb power. It is therefore important to realize when hooking up coax cable that the TV farthest from the source will receive the least amount of signal power, and if it is very distant, the resulting loss may be sufﬁcient to affect the picture quality. Rearranging the equations for vL and IC and substituting as follows will reveal that the characteristic impedance is purely resistive and is mea- sured in ohms: vL \u0002 L \u0003 d d i t L \u0003 ⇒ L \u0002 vL \u0003 d d i t L \u0003 iC \u0002 C \u0003 d d v t C \u0003 ⇒ C \u0002 iC \u0003 d d v t C \u0003 so that \u0003\u0003 C L \u0003\u0004\u0002 \u0003\u0004 \u0002 \u0003\u0003 v iC\u0004 L \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0003 d \u0004d v \u0004iL C \u0003\u0004\u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0002 \u0004\u0002\u0001\u0002 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0002 2 \u0002\u0002 \u0001 vL \u0003 d d i t L \u0003 — iC \u0003 d d v t C \u0003 APPLICATIONS  727 The most common coax cables have characteristic impedances of either 50 \u0001 or 75 \u0001, as shown in Fig. 16.25(b). In actuality they may be 53.5-\u0001 and 73.5-\u0001 lines, respectively, but they are usually grouped in the category of 50- or 75-\u0001 lines. The 75-\u0001 line is typically used for applications such as cable TV and RF equipment, while the 50-\u0001 line is typically used for test equipment, ham radio stations, and medical equipment. Two of the most common coax cables are listed in Table 16.1 with speciﬁc information about their characteristics. TABLE 16.1 Characteristics of two frequently used coax cables.

The result is that a 20-ft length of 75-\u0001 cable will not have an input impedance of 20 \u0001 but rather one that is determined by the load applied to the cable. However, if the transmission line is terminated by a resistance of 75 \u0001, the char- acteristic impedance of 75 \u0001 will appear at the source. In other words, terminating a coax cable by its characteristic impedance will make it appear as an inﬁnite line to the source. When the applied load equals the characteristic impedance of the line, the line is said to be matched. An applied load equal to the characteristic impedance also results in maximum power transfer to the load as established by the maximum power theorem. Any loading other than the characteristic impedance will result in a “reﬂection of power” back to the source. Matching the load to the line is therefore a major concern when using coax cables. For instance, take the folded-dipole antenna referred to as a yagi that was a common sight on roof tops before cable came along. The twin line cable running from the antenna to the TV had a characteristic impedance of 300 \u0001.Today, most TVs have an input impedance of 75 \u0001, and thus such antennas would have to be connected to the TV with a matching transformer (called a Balun transformer) that would make the 75-\u0001 load look like 300 \u0001 to the antenna for maximum power transfer, as shown in Fig. 16.26. In today’s world, TVs are referred to as cable ready if they have a coax connection and an input impedance of 75 \u0001 to match the cable system. One of the mistakes frequently made when installing a coax system is to hook up a splitter and fail to terminate all the output terminals. In Fig. 16.27(a), a three-way splitter is connected to two TVs with the third terminal left open for any possible future additions. The open third terminal will cause a mismatch on the incoming line, and less power FIG. 16.26 Balun matching transformer. \u0000\u0001\u0001 \u0003 \u0004\u0005 \u0003 728  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS will get to the connected TVs. This situation is corrected by terminat- ing the unused terminal with a commercially available connector as shown in Fig. 16.27(b), which simply has a 75-\u0001 resistor inside. It is also important to realize that each time you split the signal, you lose power to each of the TVs connected to the system. In fact, you lose 3 dB for each split as shown in Fig. 16.28(a). Splitting the signal in two will result in a loss of 3 dB for each TV, while splitting it three ways will result in a 6-dB loss for each TV. The concept of decibels will be covered in Chapter 24, but be aware for the moment that a 3-dB drop represents a drop in power of one-half—certainly a signiﬁcant amount. A TV can still respond pretty well with a drop of 3 dB or 6 dB, but any- thing approaching a 12-dB drop will probably result in a poor image and should be avoided. Whenever using a splitter, it is always best to connect an ampliﬁer before the splitter as shown in Fig. 16.28(b). In essence, the ampliﬁer compensates for the loss introduced by splitters and also (if well designed) will permit leaving a terminal open without disturbing the resulting signal power ﬂow. In other words, a good Unterminated connection 75-Ω cable Output Three-way splitter Input 75-Ω cable 75-Ω cable (a) \u0000\u0001\u0002 FIG. 16.27 Signal splitting: (a) three-way splitter; (b) F-type 75-\u0001 coax terminator.

COMPUTER ANALYSIS  729 ampliﬁer knows how to compensate for a terminal that is improperly terminated. Table 16.1 reveals that there is a measurable loss in power (dB) for every 100 ft of cable. For each cable, about 3 dB are lost for every 100 ft at 100 MHz, primarily because of the resistance of the center conduc- tor (44.5 \u0001/1000 ft for the 75-\u0001 line and 10 \u0001/1000 ft for the 50-\u0001 line). This is one reason why it is not recommended to ﬁrst split the sig- nal and apply the ampliﬁer at the location of the TV. In Fig. 16.29(a), the signal-to-noise (unwanted signals) ratio is quite high, and the recep- tion will be quite good. However, as shown in Fig. 16.29(b), if the sig- nal is sent down a 100-ft cable to a room distant from the source, there will be a drop in signal, and even if the noise component does not increase, the signal-to-noise ratio at the TV will be much higher. If an ampliﬁer is connected at this point, it will amplify both the signal and the unwanted noise, and the poorer signal-to-noise ratio will be fed to the TV, resulting in a poorer reception. In general, therefore, ampliﬁers should be applied where the signal-to-noise ratio is the highest.

The discussion of coax cables and their proper use could go on for a number of pages. Priorities, however, require that any further investiga- tion be left to the reader. Simply be aware that the matching process is an important one and that coax cables are not ideal systems and do have an internal resistance that can affect transmission—especially over long distances. 16.5 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice ac Bridge Network We will be using Example 16.4 to demonstrate the power of the VPRINT option in the SPECIAL library. It permits a direct determination of the magnitude and angle of any voltage in an ac network. Similarly the IPRINT option does the same for ac currents. In Example 16.4, the ac voltages across R1 and R2 were ﬁrst determined, and then Kirchhoff’s voltage law was applied to determine the voltage between the two known points. Since PSpice is designed primarily to determine the voltage at a point with respect to ground, the network of Fig. 16.7 is entered as shown in Fig. 16.30 to permit a direct calculation of the voltages across R1 and R2. The source and network elements are entered using a procedure that has been demonstrated several times in previous chapters, although for 730  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS the AC Sweep analysis to be performed in this example, the source must carry an AC level also. Fortunately, it is the same as VAMPL as shown in Fig. 16.30. It is introduced into the source description by double- clicking on the source symbol to obtain the Property Editor dialog box. The AC column is selected and the 100 V entered in the box below. Then Display is selected and Name and Value chosen. Click OK followed by Apply, and you can exit the dialog box. The result is AC \u0002 100 V added to the source description on the diagram and in the system. Using the reactance values of Fig. 16.7, the values for L and C were determined using a frequency of 1 kHz. The voltage across R1 and R2 can be determined using the Trace command in the same manner as described in the previous chapter or by using the VPRINT option. Both approaches will be discussed in this section because they have applica- tion to any ac network. The VPRINT option is under the SPECIAL library in the Place Part dialog box. Once selected, the printer symbol will appear on the screen next to the cursor, and it can be placed near the point of interest. Once the printer symbol is in place, a double-click on it will result in the Property Editor dialog box. Scrolling from left to right, type the word ok under AC, MAG, and PHASE. When each is active, the Dis- play key should be selected and the option Name and Value chosen followed by OK. When all the entries have been made, choose Apply and exit the dialog box. The result appears Fig. 16.30 for the two appli- cations of the VPRINT option. If you prefer, VPRINT1 and VPRINT2 can be added to distinguish between the two when you review the out- put data. This is accomplished by returning to the Property Editor dia- log box for each by double-clicking on the printer symbol of each and FIG. 16.30 Determining the voltage across R1 and R 2 using the VPRINT option of a PSpice analysis. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  731 selecting Value and then Display followed by Value Only. We are now ready for the simulation. The simulation is initiated by selecting the New Simulation Proﬁle icon and entering ACSweep as the Name. Then select Create to bring up the Simulation Settings dialog box. This time, we want to analyze the network at 1 kHz but are not interested in plots against time. Thus, the AC Sweep/Noise option will be selected under Analysis type in the Analysis section. An AC Sweep Type region will then appear in the dialog asking for the Start Frequency. Since we are interested in the response at only one frequency, the Start and End Frequency will be the same: 1 kHz. Since we need only one point of analysis, the Points/Decade will be 1. Click OK, and the Run PSpice icon can be selected. The SCHEMATIC1 screen will appear, and the voltage across R1 can be determined by selecting Trace followed by Add Trace and then V(R1:1). The result is the bottom display of Fig. 16.31 with only one plot point at 1 kHz. Since we ﬁxed the frequency of interest at 1 kHz, this is the only frequency with a response. The magnitude of the voltage across R1 is 60 V to match the longhand solution of Example 16.4. The phase angle associated with the voltage can be determined by the sequence Plot-Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace-P( ) from the Functions or Macros list and then V(R1:1) to obtain P(V(R1:1)) in the Trace Expression box. Click OK, and the resulting plot shows that the phase angle is near just less than \u000550° which is certainly a close match with the \u000553.13° obtained in Example 16.4. The above process made no use of the new VPRINT option just introduced. We will now see what this option provides. When the SCHEMATIC1 window appears after the simulation, the window should be exited using the X, and PSpice should be selected on the top FIG. 16.31 The resulting magnitude and phase angle for the voltage VR1 of Fig. 16.30. 732  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS menu bar of the resulting screen. A list will appear of which View Out- put File is an option. Selecting this option will result in a long list of data about the construction of the network and the results obtained from the simulation. In Fig. 16.32 the portion of the output ﬁle listing the resulting magnitude and phase angle for the voltages deﬁned by VPRINT1 and VPRINT2 is provided. Note that the voltage across R1 deﬁned by VPRINT1 is 60 V at an angle of 53.13°. The voltage across R2 as deﬁned by VPRINT2 is 80 V at an angle of 36.87°. Both are exact matches of the solutions of Example 16.4. In the future, therefore, if the VPRINT option is used, the results will appear in the output ﬁle. Now we will determine the voltage across the two branches from point a to point b. Return to SCHEMATIC1, and select Trace fol- lowed by Add Trace to obtain the list of Simulation Output Vari- ables. Then, by applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop, we ﬁnd that the desired voltage is V(R1:1)-V(R2:1) which when followed by OK will result in the plot point in the screen in the bot- tom of Fig. 16.33. Note that it is exactly 100 V as obtained in the longhand solution. The phase angle can then be determined through Plot-Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace and creating the expres- sion P(V(R1:1)-V(R2:1)). Remember that the expression can be gen- erated using the lists of Output variables and Functions,but it can FIG. 16.32 The VPRINT1 (VR1 ) and VPRINT2 (VR2 ) response for the network of Fig. 16.30. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  733 also be simply typed in from the keyboard. However, always be sure that there are as many left parentheses as there are right. Click OK, and a solution near \u0005105° appears. A better reading can be obtained by using Plot-Axis Settings-Y Axis-User Deﬁned and changing the scale to \u0005100° to \u0005110°. The result is the top screen of Fig. 16.33 with an angle closer to \u0005106.5° or 73.5° which is very close to the theoretical solution of 73.74°. Finally, the last way to ﬁnd the desired bridge voltage is to remove the VPRINT2 option and place the ground at that point as shown in Fig. 16.34. Now the voltage generated from a point above R1 to ground will be the desired voltage. Repeating a full simulation will then result in the plot of Fig. 16.35 with the the same results as Fig. 16.33. Note, however, that even though the two ﬁgures look the same, the quantities listed in the bottom left of each plot are different. Electronics Workbench Electronics Workbench will now be used to determine the voltage across the last element of the ladder network of Fig. 16.36. The mathe- matical content of this chapter would certainly suggest that this analy- sis would be a lengthy exercise in complex algebra, with one mistake (a single sign or an incorrect angle) enough to invalidate the results. How- ever, it will take only a few minutes to “draw” the network on the screen and only a few seconds to generate the results—results you can usually assume are correct if all the parameters were entered correctly. The results are certainly an excellent check against a longhand solution.

FIG. 16.35 PSpice response to the simulation of the network of Fig. 16.34. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  735 Our ﬁrst approach will be to use an oscilloscope to measure the amplitude and phase angle of the output voltage as shown in Fig. 16.36. Note that ﬁve nodes are deﬁned, with node 5 the desired voltage. The oscilloscope settings include a Time base of 20 ms/div. since the period of the 10-kHz signal is 100 ms. Channel A was set on 10 V/div. so that the full 20 V of the applied signal will have a peak value encompassing two divisions. Note that Channel A in Fig. 16.36 is connected directly to the source Vs and to the Trigger input for synchronization. Expect- ing the output voltage to have a smaller amplitude resulted in a vertical sensitivity of 1 V/div. for Channel B. The analysis was initiated by placing the Simulation switch in the 1 position. It is important to real- ize that when simulation is initiated, it will take time for networks with reactive elements to settle down and for the response to reach its steady-state condition. It is therefore wise to let a system run for a while after simulation before selecting Single on the oscilloscope to obtain a steady waveform for analysis. The resulting plots of Fig. 16.37 clearly show that the applied voltage has an amplitude of 20 V and a period of 100 ms (5 div. at 20 ms/div). The cursors sit ready for use at the left and right edges of the screen. Clicking on the small red arrow (with number 1) at the top of the oscil- loscope screen will permit you to drag it to any location on the hori- zontal axis. As you move the cursor, the magnitude of each waveform will appear in the T1 box below. By comparing positive slopes through the origin, you should see that the applied voltage is leading the output voltage by an angle that is more than 90°. Setting the cursor at the FIG. 16.36 Using the oscilloscope of Electronics Workbench to determine the voltage across the capacitor C2. 736  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS point where the output voltage on channel B passes through the origin with a positive slope, we ﬁnd that we cannot achieve exactly 0 V; but \u0005313.4 mV \u0002\u00050.313 mV (VB1) is certainly very close at 39.7 ms (T1). Knowing that the applied voltage passed through the origin at 0 ms permits the following claculation for the phase angle: \u0002 v\u0003 360° 39.7 ms\u0003 100 ms FIG. 16.37 Using Electronics Workbench to display the applied voltage and voltage across the capacitor C2 for the network of Fig. 16.36. v \u0002 142.92° with the result that the output voltage has an angle of \u0005142.92° associ- ated with it. The second cursor is found at the right edge of the screen and has a blue color. Selecting it and moving it to the peak value of the output voltage results in VB2 \u0002 1.2 V at 65.7 ms (T2). The result of all the above is VC2 \u0002 1.2 V \u0001\u0005142.92°. Our second approach will be to use the AC Analysis option under the Simulate heading. First, realize that when we were using the oscil- loscope as we did above, there was no need to pass through the sequence of dialog boxes to choose the desired analysis. All that was necessary was to simulate using either the switch or the PSpice-Run sequence—the oscilloscope was there to measure the output voltage. Remember that the source deﬁned the magnitude of the applied voltage, the frequency, and the phase shift. This time we will use the sequence COMPUTER ANALYSIS  737 Simulate-Analyses-AC Analysis to obtain the AC Analysis dialog box in which the Start and Stop frequencies will be 10 kHz and the Selected variable for analysis will be node 5 only. Selecting Simulate will then result in a magnitude-phase plot with no apparent indicators at 10 kHz. However, this is easily corrected by ﬁrst selecting one of the plots by clicking on the Voltage label at the left of the plot. Then select the Show/Hide Grid, Show/Hide Legend, and Show/Hide Cursors keys to obtain the cursors, legend, and AC Analysis dialog box. Hook on the red cursor and move it to 10 kHz. At that location, and that location only, x1 will appear as 10 kHz in the dialog box, and y1 will be 1.1946 as shown in Fig. 16.38. In other words, the cursor has deﬁned the mag- nitude of the voltage across the output capacitor as 1.1946 V or approx- imately 1.2 V as obtained above. If you then select the Phase curve and repeat the procedure, you will ﬁnd that at 10 kHz (x1) the angle is \u0005142.15° (y1) which is very close to the \u0005142.92° obtained above. FIG. 16.38 Using the AC Analysis option under Electronics Workbench to determine the magnitude and phase angle for the voltage VC2 for the network of Fig. 16.36. In total, therefore, we have two methods to obtain an ac voltage in a network—one by instrumentation and the other through the computer methods. Both are valid, although, as expected, the computer approach has a higher level of accuracy. 738  SERIES-PARALLEL ac NETWORKS PROBLEMS SECTION 16.2 Illustrative Examples 1.

GLOSSARY Ladder network A repetitive combination of series and par- allel branches that has the appearance of a ladder. Series-parallel ac network A combination of series and par- allel branches in the same network conﬁguration. Each branch may contain any number of elements whose imped- ance is dependent on the applied frequency. 17 17.1 INTRODUCTION For networks with two or more sources that are not in series or parallel, the methods described in the last two chapters cannot be applied. Rather, methods such as mesh analysis or nodal analysis must be employed. Since these methods were discussed in detail for dc circuits in Chapter 8, this chapter will consider the variations required to apply these methods to ac circuits. Dependent sources will also be introduced for both mesh and nodal analysis. The branch-current method will not be discussed again because it falls within the framework of mesh analysis. In addition to the methods mentioned above, the bridge network and \u0001-Y, Y-\u0001 conversions will also be discussed for ac circuits. Before we examine these topics, however, we must consider the sub- ject of independent and controlled sources. 17.2 INDEPENDENT VERSUS DEPENDENT (CONTROLLED) SOURCES In the previous chapters, each source appearing in the analysis of dc or ac networks was an independent source, such as E and I (or E and I) in Fig. 17.1. N A FIG. 17.1 Independent sources. E + – E + – I I Methods of Analysis and Selected Topics (ac) 744  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (ac) The term independent speciﬁes that the magnitude of the source is independent of the network to which it is applied and that the source displays its terminal characteristics even if completely isolated. A dependent or controlled source is one whose magnitude is determined (or controlled) by a current or voltage of the system in which it appears. Currently two symbols are used for controlled sources. One simply uses the independent symbol with an indication of the controlling ele- ment, as shown in Fig. 17.2. In Fig. 17.2(a), the magnitude and phase of the voltage are controlled by a voltage V elsewhere in the system, with the magnitude further controlled by the constant k1. In Fig. NA k1V + – I (a) V+ – k2I (b) FIG. 17.2 Controlled or dependent sources. Possible combinations for controlled sources are indicated in Fig. 17.4. Note that the magnitude of current sources or voltage sources can be controlled by a voltage and a current, respectively. Unlike with the independent source, isolation such that V or I \u0002 0 in Fig. 17.4(a) will result in the short-circuit or open-circuit equivalent as indicated in Fig. 17.4(b). Note that the type of representation under these conditions is controlled by whether it is a current source or a voltage source, not by the controlling agent (V or I). k1V + – I (a) V+ – k2I (b) FIG. 17.3 Special notation for controlled or dependent sources. 17.2(b), the magnitude and phase of the current source are controlled by a current I elsewhere in the system, with the magnitude further con- trolled by the constant k2. To distinguish between the dependent and independent sources, the notation of Fig. 17.3 was introduced. In recent years many respected publications on circuit analysis have accepted the notation of Fig. 17.3, although a number of excellent publications in the area of electronics continue to use the symbol of Fig. 17.2, especially in the circuit modeling for a variety of electronic devices such as the tran- sistor and FET. This text will employ the symbols of Fig. 17.3. SOURCE CONVERSIONS  745 17.3 SOURCE CONVERSIONS When applying the methods to be discussed, it may be necessary to convert a current source to a voltage source, or a voltage source to a current source. This source conversion can be accomplished in much the same manner as for dc circuits, except now we shall be dealing with phasors and impedances instead of just real numbers and resistors. Independent Sources In general, the format for converting one type of independent source to another is as shown in Fig. 17.5. EXAMPLE 17.1 Convert the voltage source of Fig. 17.6(a) to a current source.

For example, in Figs. 17.8 and 17.9, V and I, respectively, are controlled by an external portion of the network. Conversions of the other kind, where V and I are controlled by a portion of the network to be con- verted, will be considered in Sections 18.3 and 18.4. 24 \u0005 \u0001 0°\u0004\u0004 2 \u0001 90° (4 \u0005 \u0001\u000790°)(6 \u0005 \u000190°)\u0004\u0004\u0004 \u0007j 4 \u0005\u0006 j 6 \u0005 MESH ANALYSIS  747 NA 20 V + – V = V ∠ 0° + – (a) Z = 5 k\u0001 (4 \b 10–3 V) A ∠ 0° + – V = V ∠ 0° + – Z 5 k\u0001 (b) FIG. 17.8 Source conversion with a voltage-controlled voltage source.

The general approach to mesh analysis for independent sources includes the same sequence of steps appearing in Chapter 8. In fact, throughout this section the only change from the dc coverage will be to substitute impedance for resistance and admittance for conductance in the general procedure. EXAMPLE 17.3 Convert the voltage source of Fig. 17.8(a) to a current source. 748  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (ac) 1. Assign a distinct current in the clockwise direction to each independent closed loop of the network. It is not absolutely necessary to choose the clockwise direction for each loop current. However, it eliminates the need to have to choose a direction for each application. Any direction can be chosen for each loop current with no loss in accuracy as long as the remaining steps are followed properly. 2. Indicate the polarities within each loop for each impedance as determined by the assumed direction of loop current for that loop. 3. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each closed loop in the clockwise direction. Again, the clockwise direction was chosen to establish uniformity and to prepare us for the format approach to follow. a. If an impedance has two or more assumed currents through it, the total current through the impedance is the assumed current of the loop in which Kirchhoff’s voltage law is being applied, plus the assumed currents of the other loops passing through in the same direction, minus the assumed currents passing through in the opposite direction. b. The polarity of a voltage source is unaffected by the direction of the assigned loop currents. 4. Solve the resulting simultaneous linear equations for the assumed loop currents. The technique is applied as above for all networks with independent sources or for networks with dependent sources where the controlling variable is not a part of the network under investigation. If the control- ling variable is part of the network being examined, a method to be described shortly must be applied.

Solution: When applying these methods to ac circuits, it is good practice to represent the resistors and reactances (or combinations thereof) by subscripted impedances. When the total solution is found in terms of these subscripted impedances, the numerical values can be substituted to ﬁnd the unknown quantities. The network is redrawn in Fig. 17.11 with subscripted impedances: Z1 \u0002 \u0006j XL \u0002 \u0006j 2 \u0005 E1 \u0002 2 V \u00010° Z2 \u0002 R \u0002 4 \u0005 E 2 \u0002 6 V \u00010° Z3 \u0002 \u0007j XC \u0002 \u0007j 1 \u0005 Steps 1 and 2 are as indicated in Fig. 17.11.

Step 3 is modiﬁed as follows: Treat each dependent source like an independent source when Kirchhoff’s voltage law is applied to each independent loop. However, once the equation is written, substitute the equation for the controlling quantity to ensure that the unknowns are limited solely to the chosen mesh currents. 3. Step 4 is as before.

MESH ANALYSIS  751 Format Approach The format approach was introduced in Section 8.9. The steps for applying this method are repeated here with changes for its use in ac circuits: 1. Assign a loop current to each independent closed loop (as in the previous section) in a clockwise direction. 2. The number of required equations is equal to the number of chosen independent closed loops. Column 1 of each equation is formed by simply summing the impedance values of those impedances through which the loop current of interest passes and multiplying the result by that loop current. 3. We must now consider the mutual terms that are always subtracted from the terms in the ﬁrst column. It is possible to have more than one mutual term if the loop current of interest has an element in common with more than one other loop current. Each mutual term is the product of the mutual impedance and the other loop current passing through the same element. 4. The column to the right of the equality sign is the algebraic sum of the voltage sources through which the loop current of interest passes. Positive signs are assigned to those sources of voltage having a polarity such that the loop current passes from the negative to the positive terminal. Negative signs are assigned to those potentials for which the reverse is true. 5. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations for the desired loop currents. The technique is applied as above for all networks with independent sources or for networks with dependent sources where the controlling vari- able is not a part of the network under investigation.

NODAL ANALYSIS  755 analysis in Chapter 8 is suggested since the content of this section will be limited to the general conclusions of Chapter 8. The fundamental steps are the following: 1. Determine the number of nodes within the network. 2. Pick a reference node and label each remaining node with a subscripted value of voltage: V1, V2, and so on. 3. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at each node except the reference. Assume that all unknown currents leave the node for each application of Kirchhoff’s current law. 4. Solve the resulting equations for the nodal voltages. A few examples will refresh your memory about the content of Chapter 8 and the general approach to a nodal-analysis solution.

The printout of Fig. 17.26 ﬁrst deﬁnes the letters k and m to speciﬁc numerical values so that the power-of-ten format did not have to be included in the equations. Thus, the results are cleaner and easier to review. When entering the equations, remember that the j is entered as 1j without the multiplication sign between the NODAL ANALYSIS  757 NA FIG. 17.26 Using Mathcad to verify the results of Example 17.12. 1 and the j. A multiplication sign between the two will deﬁne the j as another variable. Also be sure that the multiplication process is inserted between the nodal variables and the brackets. If an error signal contin- ues to surface, it is often best to simply reenter the entire listing—errors are often not easy to spot simply by looking at the resulting equations. Finally the results are obtained and converted to polar form for com- parison with the theoretical solution. The solution of 9.949 A \u00011.837° is a very close conﬁrmation of the longhand solution. Before leaving this example, let’s look at another method for obtain- ing the polar form of the solution. The method appears in the bottom of Fig. 17.26. First deg is deﬁned as shown, and then arg is picked up from the Insert-f(x)-Insert Function-arg sequence. Next V1 is entered; the result will be in radian form but with a small black rectan- gle in the place where the units normally appear. Click on that black rectangle, and the bracket will appear and deg can be typed. When the equal sign is selected, the angle in degrees will appear. Dependent Current Sources For dependent current sources, the procedure is modiﬁed as follows: 1. Steps 1 and 2 are the same as those applied for independent sources. 2. Step 3 is modiﬁed as follows: Treat each dependent current source like an independent source when Kirchhoff’s current law is applied to each deﬁned node. However, once the equations are established, substitute the equation for the controlling quantity to ensure that the unknowns are limited solely to the chosen nodal voltages. 3. Step 4 is as before.

Independent Voltage Sources between Assigned Nodes For independent voltage sources between assigned nodes, the procedure is modiﬁed as follows: 1. Steps 1 and 2 are the same as those applied for independent sources. 2. Step 3 is modiﬁed as follows: Treat each source between deﬁned nodes as a short circuit (recall the supernode classiﬁcation of Chapter 8), and write the nodal equations for each remaining independent node. Then relate the chosen nodal voltages to the independent voltage source to ensure that the unknowns of the ﬁnal equations are limited solely to the nodal voltages. 3. Step 4 is as before.

Dependent Voltage Sources between Deﬁned Nodes For dependent voltage sources between deﬁned nodes, the procedure is modiﬁed as follows: 1. Steps 1 and 2 are the same as those applied for independent volt- age sources. 2.

Note that because the impedance Z3 is in parallel with a voltage source, it does not appear in the analysis. It will, however, affect the current through the dependent voltage source. Format Approach A close examination of Eqs. (17.1) and (17.2) in Example 17.12 will reveal that they are the same equations that would have been obtained using the format approach introduced in Chapter 8. Recall that the approach required that the voltage source ﬁrst be converted to a current source, but the writing of the equations was quite direct and minimized any chances of an error due to a lost sign or missing term. The sequence of steps required to apply the format approach is the following: 1. Choose a reference node and assign a subscripted voltage label to the (N \u0007 1) remaining independent nodes of the network. 2. The number of equations required for a complete solution is equal to the number of subscripted voltages (N \u0007 1). Column 1 of each equation is formed by summing the admittances tied to the node of interest and multiplying the result by that subscripted nodal voltage. 3. The mutual terms are always subtracted from the terms of the ﬁrst column. It is possible to have more than one mutual term if the nodal voltage of interest has an element in common with more than one other nodal voltage. Each mutual term is the product of the mutual admittance and the other nodal voltage tied to that admittance. 4. The column to the right of the equality sign is the algebraic sum of the current sources tied to the node of interest. A current source is assigned a positive sign if it supplies current to a node, and a negative sign if it draws current from the node. 5.

Further, the value of each impedance of the \u0005 is equal to the sum of the possible product combinations of the impedances of theY, divided by the impedances of theY farthest from the impedance to be determined.

There is no need to continually use 1 kHz. Any frequency will do, but remember to use the chosen frequency to ﬁnd the network components and when setting up the simulation. For the current sources, ISIN was chosen so that the phase angle could be speciﬁed (even though it is 0°), although the symbol does not have the arrow used in the text material. The direction must be recog- nized as pointing from the \u0003 to \u0002 sign of the source. That requires that the sources I1 and I2 be set as shown in Fig. 17.55. The source I2 is reversed by using the Mirror Vertically option obtained by right- clicking the source symbol on the screen. Setting up the ISIN source is the same as that employed with the VSIN source. It can be found under the SOURCE library, and its attributes are the same as for the VSIN source. For each source, IOFF is set to 0 A, and the amplitude is the peak value of the source current. The frequency will be the same for each source. Then VPRINT1 is selected from the SPECIAL library and placed to generate the desired nodal voltages. Finally the remaining elements are added to the network as shown in Fig. 17.55. For each source the symbol is double-clicked to generate the Property Editor dialog box. AC is set at the 6-A level for the I1 source and at 4 A for the I2 source, followed by Display and Name and Value for each. It will appear as shown in Fig. 17.55. A double-click on each VPRINT1 option will also provide the Property Editor, so OK can be added under AC, MAG, and PHASE. For each quantity, Display is selected followed by Name and Value and OK. Then Value is selected and VPRINT1 is displayed as Value only. Selecting Apply and leaving the dialog box will result in the listing next to each source in Fig. 17.55. For VPRINT2 the listing on Value must ﬁrst be changed from VPRINT1 to VPRINT2 before selecting Display and Apply. NA FIG. 17.55 Using PSpice to verify the results of Example 17.16.

Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS) Our interest will now turn to controlled sources in the PSpice environment. Controlled sources are not particularly difﬁcult to apply once a few important ele- ments of their use are understood. The network of Fig. 17.14 has a current-controlled current source in the center leg of the conﬁguration. The magnitude of the current source is k times the current through resis- tor R1, where k can be greater or less than 1. The resulting schematic, appearing in Fig. 17.57, seems quite complex in the area of the con- trolled source, but once the role of each component is understood, it will not be that difﬁcult to understand. First, since it is the only new element in the schematic, let us concentrate on the controlled source. Current-controlled current sources (CCCS) are called up under the ANALOG library as F and appear as shown in the center of Fig. 17.57. 778  METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SELECTED TOPICS (ac) NA Take special note of the direction of the current in each part of the sym- bol. In particular, note that the sensing current of F has the same direc- tion as the deﬁning controlling current in Fig. 17.14. In addition, note that the controlled current source also has the same direction as the source in Fig. 17.14. If we double-click on the CCCS symbol, the Property Editor dialog box will appear with the GAIN (k as described above) set at 1. In this example the gain must be set at 0.7, so click on the region below the GAIN label and enter 0.7. Then select Display followed by Name and Value-OK. Exit the Property Editor, and GAIN \u0005 0.7 will appear with the CCCS as shown in Fig. 17.57. The other new component in this schematic is IPRINT; it can be found in the SPECIAL library. It is used to tell the program to list the current in the branch of interest in the output ﬁle. If you fail to tell the program which output data you would like, it will simply run through the simulation and list speciﬁc features of the network but will not pro- vide any voltages or currents. In this case the current I2 through the resistor R2 is desired. Double-clicking on the IPRINT component will result in the Property Editor dialog box with a number of elements that need to be deﬁned—much like that for VPRINT. First enter OK beneath AC and follow with Display-Name and Value-OK. Repeat for MAG and PHASE, and then select Apply before leaving the dialog box. The OK is designed simply to tell the software program that these are the quantities that it is “ok” to generate and provide. The purpose of the Apply at the end of each visit to the Property Editor dialog box is to “apply” the changes made to the network under investigation. When you exit the Property Editor, the three chosen parameters will appear on the schematic with the OK directive. You may ﬁnd that the labels FIG. 17.57 Using PSpice to verify the results of Example 17.8. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  779 will appear all over the IPRINT symbol. No problem—just click on each, and move to a more convenient location. The remaining components of the network should be fairly familiar, but don’t forget to Mirror Vertically the voltage source E2. In addi- tion, do not forget to call up the Property Editor for each source and set the level of AC, FREQ, VAMPL, and VOFF and be sure that the PHASE is set on the default value of 0°. The value appears with each parameter in Fig. 17.57 for each source. Always be sure to select Apply before leaving the Property Editor. After placing all the components on the screen, you must connect them with a Place wire selection. Nor- mally, this is pretty straightforward. However, with controlled sources there is often the need to cross over wires without making a connec- tion. In general, when you’re placing a wire over another wire and you don’t want a connection to be made, click a spot on one side of the wire to be crossed to create the temporary red square. Then cross the wire, and make another click to establish another red square. If the connec- tion is done properly, the crossed wire should not show a connection point (a small red dot). In this example the top of the controlling cur- rent was connected ﬁrst from the E1 source. Then a wire was connected from the lower end of the sensing current to the point where a 90° turn up the page was to be made. The wire was clicked in place at this point before crossing the original wire and clicked again before making the right turn to resistor R1. You will not ﬁnd a small red dot where the wires cross. Now for the simulation. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, select AC Sweep/Noise with a Start and End Frequency of 1 kHz. There will be 1 Point/Decade. Click OK, and select the Run Spice key; a SCHEMATIC1 will result that should be exited to obtain the Orcad Capture screen. Select PSpice followed by View Output File, and scroll down until you read AC ANALYSIS such as appearing in Fig. 17.58. The magnitude of the desired current is 1.615 mA with a phase angle of 0°, a perfect match with the theoretical analysis to fol- low.

Network Theorems (ac) Th18 18.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter will parallel Chapter 9, which dealt with network theorems as applied to dc networks. It would be time well spent to review each theorem in Chapter 9 before beginning this chapter because many of the comments offered there will not be repeated. Due to the need for developing conﬁdence in the application of the various theorems to networks with controlled (dependent) sources, some sections have been divided into two parts: independent sources and dependent sources. Theorems to be considered in detail include the superposition theo- rem, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, and the maximum power theo- rem. The substitution and reciprocity theorems and Millman’s theorem are not discussed in detail here because a review of Chapter 9 will enable you to apply them to sinusoidal ac networks with little difﬁculty. 18.2 SUPERPOSITION THEOREM You will recall from Chapter 9 that the superposition theorem elimi- nated the need for solving simultaneous linear equations by considering the effects of each source independently. To consider the effects of each source, we had to remove the remaining sources. This was accom- plished by setting voltage sources to zero (short-circuit representation) and current sources to zero (open-circuit representation). The current through, or voltage across, a portion of the network produced by each source was then added algebraically to ﬁnd the total solution for the current or voltage. The only variation in applying this method to ac networks with inde- pendent sources is that we will now be working with impedances and phasors instead of just resistors and real numbers. The superposition theorem is not applicable to power effects in ac networks since we are still dealing with a nonlinear relationship. It can be applied to networks with sources of different frequencies only if 792  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) the total response for each frequency is found independently and the results are expanded in a nonsinusoidal expression, as appearing in Chapter 25. One of the most frequent applications of the superposition theorem is to electronic systems in which the dc and ac analyses are treated sep- arately and the total solution is the sum of the two. It is an important application of the theorem because the impact of the reactive elements changes dramatically in response to the two types of independent sources. In addition, the dc analysis of an electronic system can often deﬁne important parameters for the ac analysis. Example 18.4 will demonstrate the impact of the applied source on the general conﬁgura- tion of the network. We will ﬁrst consider networks with only independent sources to provide a close association with the analysis of Chapter 9.

EXAMPLE 18.6 Determine the current IL through the resistor RL of Fig. 18.21. Solution: Note that the controlling variable V is determined by the network to be analyzed. From the above discussions, it is understood that the dependent source cannot be set to zero unless V is zero. If we set I to zero, the network lacks a source of voltage, and V \u0002 0 with mV \u0002 0. The resulting IL under this condition is zero. Obviously, there- fore, the network must be analyzed as it appears in Fig. 18.21, with the result that neither source can be eliminated, as is normally done using the superposition theorem. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we have VL \u0002 V \u0003 mV \u0002 (1 \u0003 m)V and IL \u0002\u0002 The result, however, must be found in terms of I since V and mV are only dependent variables. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law gives us I \u0002 I1 \u0003 IL \u0002\u0003 and I \u0002 V\u0002 \u0003 \u0003 or V \u0002 Substituting into the above yields IL \u0002\u0002 \u0002\u0003 Therefore, IL \u0002 18.3 THE´VENIN’S THEOREM Thévenin’s theorem, as stated for sinusoidal ac circuits, is changed only to include the term impedance instead of resistance; that is, any two-terminal linear ac network can be replaced with an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source and an impedance in series, as shown in Fig. 18.22. Since the reactances of a circuit are frequency dependent, the Thévenin circuit found for a particular network is applicable only at one fre- quency.

A great deal more will be said about equivalent circuits and the operations performed to obtain the net- work of Fig. 18.34, but for now let us limit our attention to the manner in which the Thévenin equivalent circuit is obtained. Note in Fig. 18.34 that the equivalent circuit includes a resistor of 2.3 k\u0001 and a controlled current source whose magnitude is determined by the product of a fac- tor of 100 and the current I1 in another part of the network.

Note in Fig. 18.34 the absence of the coupling capacitors for the ac analysis. In general, coupling capacitors are designed to be open cir- cuits for dc analysis and short circuits for ac analysis. The short-circuit equivalent is valid because the other impedances in series with the cou- pling capacitors are so much larger in magnitude that the effect of the coupling capacitors can be ignored. Both RB and RC are now tied to ground because the dc source was set to zero volts (superposition) and replaced by a short-circuit equivalent to ground. For the analysis to follow, the effect of the resistor RB will be ignored since it is so much larger than the parallel 2.3-k\u0001 resistor. ZTh When Ei is set to zero volts, the current I1 will be zero amperes, and the controlled source 100I1 will be zero amperes also. The result is an open-circuit equivalent for the source, as appearing in Fig. 18.35. It is fairly obvious from Fig. 18.35 that ZTh \u0002 2 k\u0003 ETh For ETh, the current I1 of Fig. 18.34 will be I1 \u0002\u0002 \u0002 and 100I1 \u0002 (100)\u0002\u0003 \u0002 35.71 \b 10 \u00043/\u0001 Ei Referring to Fig. 18.36, we ﬁnd that ETh \u0002\u0004(100I1)RC \u0002\u0004(35.71 \b 10 \u00043/\u0001 Ei )(2 \b 10 3 \u0001) ETh \u0002\u000471.42Ei The Thévenin equivalent circuit appears in Fig. 18.37 with the orig- inal load RL.

Dependent Sources For dependent sources with a controlling variable not in the network under investigation, the procedure indicated above can be applied. How- ever, for dependent sources of the other type, where the controlling vari- able is part of the network to which the theorem is to be applied, another approach must be employed. The necessity for a different approach will be demonstrated in an example to follow. The method is not limited to depen- dent sources of the latter type. It can also be applied to any dc or sinusoidal ac network. However, for networks of independent sources, the method of application employed in Chapter 9 and presented in the ﬁrst portion of this section is generally more direct, with the usual savings in time and errors. The new approach to Thévenin’s theorem can best be introduced at this stage in the development by considering the Thévenin equivalent circuit of Fig. 18.38(a). As indicated in Fig. 18.38(b), the open-circuit terminal voltage (Eoc) of the Thévenin equivalent circuit is the Thévenin equivalent voltage; that is, (18.1) If the external terminals are short circuited as in Fig. 18.38(c), the resulting short-circuit current is determined by (18.2) or, rearranged, ZTh \u0002 and (18.3) Equations (18.1) and (18.3) indicate that for any linear bilateral dc or ac network with or without dependent sources of any type, if the open- circuit terminal voltage of a portion of a network can be determined along with the short-circuit current between the same two terminals, the Thévenin equivalent circuit is effectively known. A few examples will make the method quite clear. The advantage of the method, which was stressed earlier in this section for independent sources, should now be more obvious. The current Isc, which is necessary to ﬁnd ZTh, is in gen- eral more difﬁcult to obtain since all of the sources are present. There is a third approach to the Thévenin equivalent circuit that is also useful from a practical viewpoint. The Thévenin voltage is found as in the two previous methods.

THÉVENIN’S THEOREM  805 obtained by applying a source of voltage to the terminals of interest and determining the source current as indicated in Fig. 18.39. For this method, the source voltage of the original network is set to zero. The Thévenin impedance is then determined by the following equation: (18.4) Note that for each technique, ETh \u0002 Eoc, but the Thévenin impedance is found in different ways. EXAMPLE 18.10 Using each of the three techniques described in this section, determine the Thévenin equivalent circuit for the network of Fig. 18.40.

Since the Thévenin and Norton impedances are the same for a particular network, certain portions of the discussion will be quite similar to those encountered in the previous section. We will ﬁrst consider independent sources and the approach developed in Chapter 9, followed by dependent sources and the new techniques developed for Thévenin’s theorem. You will recall from Chapter 9 that Norton’s theorem allows us to replace any two-terminal linear bilateral ac network with an equiva- lent circuit consisting of a current source and an impedance, as in Fig. 18.59. The Norton equivalent circuit, like the Thévenin equivalent circuit, is applicable at only one frequency since the reactances are frequency dependent.

NORTON’S THEOREM  811Th Independent Sources The procedure outlined below to ﬁnd the Norton equivalent of a sinu- soidal ac network is changed (from that in Chapter 9) in only one respect: the replacement of the term resistance with the term imped- ance. 1. Remove that portion of the network across which the Norton equivalent circuit is to be found. 2. Mark (\u0001, ●, and so on) the terminals of the remaining two-terminal network. 3. Calculate ZN by ﬁrst setting all voltage and current sources to zero (short circuit and open circuit, respectively) and then ﬁnding the resulting impedance between the two marked terminals. 4. Calculate IN by ﬁrst replacing the voltage and current sources and then ﬁnding the short-circuit current between the marked terminals. 5. Draw the Norton equivalent circuit with the portion of the circuit previously removed replaced between the terminals of the Norton equivalent circuit. The Norton and Thévenin equivalent circuits can be found from each other by using the source transformation shown in Fig. 18.60. The source transformation is applicable for any Thévenin or Norton equiva- lent circuit determined from a network with any combination of inde- pendent or dependent sources. – + ZTh ETh = INZNZNIN = ETh ZTh ZN = ZTh ZTh = ZN FIG. 18.60 Conversion between the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits.

A careful review of Chapter 9 will enable you to apply these theorems to sinusoidal ac networks with little difﬁculty. A number of problems in the use of these theorems appear in the problems section at the end of the chapter. 18.7 APPLICATIONS Soldering Gun Soldering and welding are two operations that are best performed by the application of heat that is unaffected by the thermal characteristics of the materials involved. In other words, the heat applied should not be sensitive to the changing parameters of the welding materials, the met- als involved, or the welding conditions. The arc (a heavy current) estab- lished in the welding process should remain ﬁxed in magnitude to ensure an even weld. This is best accomplished by ensuring a ﬁxed cur- rent through the system even though the load characteristics may change—that is, by ensuring a constant current supply of sufﬁcient amperage to establish the required arc for the welding equipment or even heating of the soldering iron tip. A further requirement for the soldering process is that the heat developed be sufﬁcient to raise the solder to its melting point of about 800°F. The soldering gun of Fig. 18.89(a) employs a unique approach to establishing a ﬁxed current through the soldering tip. The soldering tip is actually part of a secondary winding of a transformer (Chapter 21) having only one turn as its secondary as shown in Fig. 18.89(b). Because of the heavy currents that will be established in this single-turn secondary, it is quite large in size to ensure that it can handle the cur- rent and to minimize its resistance level.

The Universal® unit of Fig. 18.89 is rated 140 W/100 W, indicating that it has two levels of power controlled by the trigger. As you pull the trigger, the ﬁrst setting will be at 140 W, and a fully depressed trigger will provide 100 W of power. The inductance of the primary is 285 mH at the 140-W setting and 380 mH at the 100-W setting, indicating that the switch controls how many windings of the primary will be part of the transformer action for each wattage rating, as shown in Fig. 18.89(c). Since induc- tance is a direct function of the number of turns, the 140-W setting has fewer turns than the 100-W setting. The dc resistance of the primary was found to be about 11.2 \u0005 for the 140-W setting and 12.8 \u0005 for the 100-W setting, which makes sense also since more turns will require a longer wire and the resistance should increase accordingly. Under rated operating conditions, the primary current for each set- ting can be determined using Ohm’s law in the following manner: Th \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0003\u0004\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b \t \u0004\f\r\u0007\u000e \u000f\u0010\u0011 \u0012 \u000f\u0011\u0011 \u0012 \u0013\u000e\u0006\u0014\t\u000e\u0015 \u0016\f\u000e\u0007 \u0017\u0007 \f˘\b\t\u000e\u0015 (c) Primary Is Secondary 140 W 100 W Ip 120 V ac OFF FIG. 18.89 Soldering gun: (a) appearance; (b) internal construction; (c) turns ratio control. 824  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) Th For 140 W, Ip \u0001 \u0003 V P p \u0003\u0001 \u0003 1 1 4 2 0 0 W V \u0003 \u0001 1.17 A For 100 W, Ip \u0001 \u0003 V P p \u0003\u0001 \u0003 1 1 0 2 0 0 W V \u0003 \u0001 0.83 A As expected, the current demand is more for the 140-W setting than for the 100-W setting. Using the measured values of input inductance and resistance for the 140-W setting, the equivalent circuit of Fig. 18.90(a) will result. Using the applied 60 Hz to determine the reactance of the coil and then determining the total impedance seen by the pri- mary will result in the following for the source current: XL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2p(60 Hz)(285 mH) \u0001 107.44 \u0005 and ZT \u0001 R \u0002 j XL \u0001 11.2 \u0005\u0002 j 107.44 \u0005 \u0001 108.02 \u0005 \u000184.05° so that \tIp\t \u0001 \u0006 \u0003 Z E T \u0003\u0006 \u0001 \u0003 10 1 8 2 . 0 02 V \u0005\u0003 \u0001 1.11 A which is a close match with the rated level. For the 100-W level of Fig. 18.90(b), the following analysis would result: XL \u0001 2pfL \u0001 2p(60 Hz)(380 mH) \u0001 143.26 \u0005 and ZT \u0001 R \u0002 j XL \u0001 12.8 \u0005\u0002 j 143.26 \u0005 \u0001 143.83 \u0005 \u000184.89° so that \tIp\t \u0001 \u0006 \u0003 Z E T \u0003\u0006 \u0001 \u0003 14 1 3 2 . 0 83 V \u0005\u0003 \u0001 0.83 A which is a match to hundredths place with the value calculated from rated conditions. Removing the tip and measuring the primary and secondary voltages resulted in 120 V/0.38 V for the 140-W setting and 120 V/0.31 V for the 100-W setting, respectively. Since the voltages of a transformer are directly related to the turns ratio, the number of turns in the primary (Np) to that of the secondary (Ns) can be estimated by the following for each setting: For 140 W, \u0003 N N p s \u0003\u0001 \u0003 0 1 . 2 3 0 8V V \u0003 \u0003 316 For 100 W, \u0003 N N p s \u0003\u0001 \u0003 0 1 . 2 3 0 1V V \u0003 \u0003 387 Looking at the photograph of Fig. 18.89(b), it would certainly appear that there are 300 or more turns in the primary winding. The currents of a transformer are related by the turns ratio in the fol- lowing manner, permitting a calculation of the secondary currents for each setting: For 140 W, Is \u0001 \u0003 N N p s \u0003Ip \u0001 316(1.17 A) \u0003 370 A Rp 12.8 \u0002 Lp 380 mH + 120 V 60 Hz – Ip 100 W (b) Rp 11.2 \u0002 Lp 285 mH + 120 V 60 Hz – Ip 140 W (a) FIG. 18.90 Equivalent circuits for the soldering iron of Fig. 18.89(a): (a) at 140-W setting; (b) at 100-W setting.

The resulting current levels are probably higher than you might have expected, but keep in mind that the above analysis does not include the effect of the reﬂected impedance from the secondary to the primary that will reduce the primary current level (to be discussed in Chapter 21). In addition, as the soldering tip heats up, its resistance increases, further reducing the resulting current levels. Using an Amp-Clamp ®, the current in the secondary was found to exceed 300 A when the power was ﬁrst applied and the soldering tip was cold. How- ever, as the tip heated up because of the high current levels, the current through the primary dropped to about 215 A for the 140-W setting and to 180 A for the 100-W setting. These high currents are part of the rea- son that the lifetime of most soldering tips on soldering guns is about 20 hours. Eventually, the tip will simply begin to melt. Using these levels of current and the given power rating, the resistance of the sec- ondary can be approximated as follows: For 140 W, R \u0001 \u0003 I P 2\u0003\u0001 \u0003 (2 1 1 4 5 0 A W ) 2\u0003 \u0003 3 m\u0003 For 100 W, R \u0001 \u0003 I P 2\u0003\u0001 \u0003 (1 1 8 0 0 0 A W ) 2\u0003 \u0003 3 m\u0003 which is as low as expected when you consider the cross-sectional area of the secondary and the fact that the tip is a short section of low-resistance, tin-plated copper. One of the obvious advantages of the soldering gun versus the iron is that the iron is off when you release the trigger, thus reducing energy costs and extending the life of the tip. Applying dc current rather than ac to develop a constant current would be impractical because the high current demand would require a series of large batteries in parallel. The above investigation was particularly interesting because of the manner in which the constant current characteristic was established, the levels of current established, and the excellent manner in which some of the theory introduced in the text was veriﬁed. Electronic Systems One of the blessings in the analysis of electronic systems is that the superposition theorem can be applied so that the dc analysis and ac analysis can be performed separately. The analysis of the dc system will affect the ac response, but the analysis of each is a distinct, separate process. Even though electronic systems have not been investigated in this text, a number of important points can be made in the description to follow that support some of the theory presented in this and recent chapters, so inclusion of this description is totally valid at this point. Consider the network of Fig. 18.91 with a transistor power ampliﬁer, an 8-\u0005 speaker as the load, and a source with an internal resistance of 800 \u0005. Note that each component of the design was isolated by a color box Th826  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) to emphasize the fact that each component must be carefully weighed in any good design. As mentioned above, the analysis can be separated into a dc and an ac component. For the dc analysis the two capacitors can be replaced by an open-circuit equivalent (Chapter 10), resulting in an isolation of the ampliﬁer network as shown in Fig. 18.92. Given the fact that VBE will be about 0.7 V dc for any operating transistor, the base current IB can be found as follows using Kirchhoff’s voltage law: IB \u0001 \u0003 V R R B B \u0003 \u0001 \u0003 VCC R \u0004 B VBE\u0003 \u0001 \u0003 22 V 47 \u0004 k\u0005 0.7 V\u0003 \u0001 453.2 mA For transistors, the collector current IC is related to the base current by IC \u0001 bIB, and IC \u0001 bIB \u0001 (200)(453.2 mA) \u0001 90.64 mA Finally, through Kirchhoff’s voltage law, the collector voltage (also the collector-to-emitter voltage since the emitter is grounded) can be determined as follows: VC \u0001 VCE \u0001 VCC \u0004 ICRC \u0001 22 V \u0004 (90.64 mA)(100 \u0005) \u0001 12.94 V For the dc analysis, therefore, IB \u0001 453.2 mA IC \u0001 90.64 mA VCE \u0001 12.94 V which will deﬁne a point of dc operation for the transistor. This is an important aspect of electronic design since the dc operating point will have an effect on the ac gain of the network. Now, using superposition, we can analyze the network from an ac viewpoint by setting all dc sources to zero (replaced by ground connec- tions) and replacing both capacitors by short circuits as shown in Fig. 18.93. Substituting the short-circuit equivalent for the capacitors is valid because at 10 kHz (the midrange for human hearing response), the reactance of the capacitor is determined by XC \u0001 1/2pfC \u0001 15.92 \u0005 which can be ignored when compared to the series resistors at the source and load. In other words, the capacitor has played the important role of isolating the ampliﬁer for the dc response and completing the network for the ac response.

The transistor has now been replaced by an equivalent network that will represent the behavior of the device. This process will be covered in detail in your basic electronics courses. This transistor conﬁguration has an input impedance of 200 \u0005 and a current source whose magnitude is sensitive to the base current in the input cir- cuit and to the amplifying factor for this transistor of 200. The 47-k\u0005 resistor in parallel with the 200-\u0005 input impedance of the transistor can be ignored, so the input current Ii and base current Ib are determined by Ii \u0003 Ib \u0001 \u0003 Rs V \u0002 s Ri \u0003 \u0001\u0001 \u0003 1V 1k ( \u0005 p-p)\u0003 \u0001 1 mA (p-p) The collector current IC is then IC \u0001 bIb \u0001 (200)(1 mA ( p-p)) \u0001 200 mA ( p-p) and the current to the speaker is determined by the current divider rule as follows: IL \u0001\u0001 0.926IC \u0001 0.926(200 mA (p-p)) \u0001 185.2 mA (p-p) with the voltage across the speaker being VL \u0001\u0004ILRL \u0001\u0004(185.2 mA ( p-p))(8 \u0005) \u0001\u00041.48 V The power to the speaker is then determined as follows: Pspeaker \u0001 VLrms ILrms \u0001 \u0003 (VL( p-p) 8 )(IL( p-p))\u0003 \u0001 \u0001 34.26 mW which is relatively low. It would initially appear that the above was a good design for distribution of power to the speaker because a majority (1.48 V)(185.2 mA (p-p))\u0003\u0003\u0003 8 100 \u0005(IC)\u0003\u0003 100 \u0005\u0002 8 \u0005 1 V (p-p)\u0003\u0003 800 \u0005\u0002 200 \u0005 (a) RC 100 \u0002 Rs 800 \u0002 Ii Vs 1V(p-p) + – RL 8 \u0002Ri 200 \u0002RB B E 47 kΩ I ≅ 0 A Ib βIb 200Ib C IC + – IL VL Transistor equivalent circuit (b) 100 \u0002 8 \u0002 100 \u0002 Impedance matching transformer + – 200 mA 100 \u0002 100 \u0002 100 mA 100 mA VL FIG. 18.94 (a) Network of Fig. 18.93 following the substitution of the transistor equivalent network; (b) effect of the matching transformer. 828  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) Th of the collector current went to the speaker. However, one must always keep in mind that power is the product of voltage and current. A high current with a very low voltage will result in a lower power level. In this case, the voltage level is too low. However, if we introduce a matching transformer that makes the 8-\u0005 resistive load “look like” 100 \u0005 as shown in Fig. 18.94(b), establishing maximum power conditions, the current to the load will drop to half of the previous amount because cur- rent splits through equal resistors. But the voltage across the load will increase to VL \u0001 ILRL \u0001 (100 mA ( p-p))(100 \u0005) \u0001 10 V ( p-p) and the power level to Pspeaker \u0001 \u0003 (VL( p-p) 8 )(IL( p-p))\u0003 \u0001 \u0003 (10 V)(1 8 00 mA)\u0003 \u0001 125 mW which is 3.6 times the gain without the matching transformer. For the 100-\u0005 load, the dc conditions are unaffected due to the iso- lation of the capacitor CC, and the voltage at the collector is 12.94 V as shown in Fig. 18.95(a). For the ac response with a 100-\u0005 load, the out- put voltage as determined above will be 10 V peak-to-peak (5 V peak) as shown in Fig. 18.95(b). Note the out-of-phase relationship with the input due to the opposite polarity of VL. The full response at the collec- tor terminal of the transistor can then be drawn by superimposing the ac response on the dc response as shown in Fig. 18.95(c) (another appli- cation of the superposition theorem). In other words, the dc level sim- ply shifts the ac waveform up or down and does not disturb its shape. The peak-to-peak value remains the same, and the phase relationship is unaltered. The total waveform at the load will include only the ac response of Fig. 18.95(b) since the dc component has been blocked out by the capacitor.

The voltage at the source will appear as shown in Fig. 18.96(a), while the voltage at the base of the transistor will appear as shown in Fig. 18.96(b) because of the presence of the dc component. A number of important concepts were presented in the above exam- ple, with some probably leaving a question or two because of your lack of experience with transistors. However, if nothing else is evident from the above example, it should be the power of the superposition theorem to permit an isolation of the dc and ac responses and the ability to com- bine both if the total response is desired.

You will ﬁnd that it is not necessary to specify an analysis for each, even though one is essentially an ac sweep and the other is a bias point calcu- lation. When AC Sweep is selected, the program will automatically per- form the bias calculations and display the results in the output ﬁle. The resulting schematic appears in Fig. 18.97 with VSIN and VDC as the SOURCE voltages. The placement of all the R-L-C elements and FIG. 18.97 Using PSpice to apply superposition to the network of Fig. 18.12. 830  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) Th the dc source should be quite straightforward at this point. For the ac source, be sure to double-click on the source symbol to obtain the Property Editor dialog box. Then set AC to 4 V, FREQ to 1 kHz, PHASE to 0°, VAMPL to 4 V, and VOFF to 0 V. In each case choose Name and Value under the Display heading so that we have a review of the parameters on the screen. Also, be sure to Apply before exiting the dialog box. Obtain the VPRINT1 option from the SPECIAL library, place it as shown, and then double-click to obtain its Property Editor. The parameters AC, MAG, and PHASE must then recieve the OK listing, and Name and Value must be applied to each under Display before you choose Apply and OK. The network is then ready for simulation. After you have selected the New Simulation Proﬁle icon, the New Simulation dialog box will appear in which SuperpositionAC is entered as the Name.Following the selection of Create,the Simulation Settings dialog box will appear in which AC Sweep/Noise is selected. The Start and End Frequencies are both set at 1 kHz, and 1 is entered for the Points/Decade request. Click OK, and then select the Run PSpice key; the SCHEMATIC1 screen will result with an axis extend- ing from 0.5 kHz to 1.5 kHz. Through the sequence Trace-Add Trace- V(R3:1)-OK,the plot point appearing in the bottom of Fig. 18.98 will result. Its value is slightly above the 2-V level and could be read as 2.05 V which compares very nicely with the hand-calculated solution of 2.06 V. The phase angle can be obtained from Plot-Add Plot to Window- Trace-Add Trace-P(V(R3:1)) to obtain a phase angle close to \u000433°. Additional accuracy can be added to the phase plot through the sequence Plot-Axis Settings-Y Axis-User Deﬁned \u000240d to \u000230d-OK, resulting in the \u000432.5° reading of Fig. 18.98— again, very close to the hand cal- FIG. 18.98 The output results from the simulation of the network of Fig. 18.97.

By exiting the SCHEMATIC1 screen, we obtain the Orcad Cap- ture window on which PSpice can be selected followed by View Out- put File. The result is the printout of Fig. 18.99 which has both the dc and the ac solutions. The SMALL SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION in- cludes the nodes of the network and their dc levels. The node numbers are deﬁned under the netlist starting on line 30. In particular, note the dc level of 3.6 V at node N00676 which is at the top of resistor R3 in Fig. 18.97. Also note that the dc level of both ends of the inductor is the same value because of the substitution of a short-circuit equivalent for the inductor for dc analysis. The ac solution appears under the AC ANALYSIS heading as 2.06 V at \u000432.66°, which again is a great ver- iﬁcation of the results of Example 18.4. Th FIG. 18.99 The output ﬁle for the dc (SMALL SIGNAL BIAS SOLUTION) and AC ANALYSIS for the network of Fig. 18.97. 832  NETWORK THEOREMS (ac) Finally, if a plot of the voltage across resistor R3 is desired, we must return to the New Simulation Proﬁle and enter a new Name such as SuperpositionAC1 followed by Create ﬁll in the Simulation Proﬁle dialog box. This time, however, we will choose the Time Domain(Transient) option so that we can obtain a plot against time. The fact that the source has a deﬁned frequency of 1 kHz will tell the program which frequency to apply. The Run to time will be 5 ms, resulting in a ﬁve-cycle display of the 1-kHz signal. The Start saving data after will remain at 0 s, and the Maximum step size will be 5 ms/1000 \u0001 5 ms. Click OK, and select the Run PSpice icon; the SCHEMATIC1 screen will result again. This time Trace-Add Trace- V(R3:1)-OK will result in the plot of Fig. 18.100 which clearly shows a dc level of 3.6 V. Setting a cursor at t \u0001 0 s (A1) will result in 3.6 V in the Probe Cursor display box. Placing the other cursor at the peak value at 2.34 ms (A2) will result in a peak value of about 5.66 V. The difference between the peak and the dc level provides the peak value of the ac signal and is listed as 2.06 V in the same Probe Cursor display box. A variety of options have now been introduced to ﬁnd a particular voltage or current in a network with both dc and ac sources. It is cer- tainly satisfying that they all verify our theoretical solution. Thévenin’s Theorem The next application will parallel the methods employed to determine the Thévenin equivalent circuit for dc circuits. The network of Fig. 18.28 will appear as shown in Fig. 18.101 when the open-circuit Thévenin voltage is to be determined. The open circuit is simulated by using a resistor of 1 T (1 million M\u0005). The resistor is necessary to establish a connection between the right side of inductor L2 and ground—nodes cannot be left ﬂoating for Orcad simulations.

The magnitude of the Thévenin voltage is 5.187 V to compare with the 5.08 V of Exam- ple 18.8, while the phase angle is \u000477.13° to compare with the \u000477.09° of the same example—excellent results.

Next, the short-circuit current will be determined using IPRINT as shown in Fig. 18.103, to permit a determination of the Thévenin imped- ance. The resistance Rcoil of 1 m\u0005 had to be introduced because induc- tors cannot be treated as ideal elements when using PSpice; they must all show some series internal resistance. Note that the short-circuit current will pass directly through the printer symbol for IPRINT. Inci- dentally, there is no need to exit the SCHEMATIC1 developed above to determine the Thévenin voltage. Simply delete VPRINT and R3, and insert IPRINT. Then run a new simulation to obtain the results of Fig. 18.104. The magnitude of the short-circuit current is 0.936 A at an angle of \u0004108°.

VPRINT1 will provide the open cir- cuit Thévenin voltage between the points of interest. Running the sim- ulation in the AC Sweep mode at 1 kHz will result in the output ﬁle appearing in Fig. 18.106, revealing that the Thévenin voltage is 210 V \u00010°. Substituting the numerical values of this example into the equa- tion obtained in Example 18.12 conﬁrms the result: ETh \u0001 (1 \u0002 m)IR1 \u0001 (1 \u0002 20) (5 mA \u00010°)(2 k\u0005) \u0001 210 V\u00010° Th FIG. 18.106 The output ﬁle for the open-circuit Thévenin voltage for the network of Fig. 18.105. Next, the short-circuit current must be determined using the IPRINT option. Note in Fig. 18.107 that the only difference between this net- work and that of Fig. 18.106 is the replacement of Roc with IPRINT and the removal of VPRINT1. There is therefore no need to completely “redraw” the network. Just make the changes and run a new simulation. The result of the new simulation as shown in Fig. 18.108 is a current of 5 mA at an angle of 0°. The ratio of the two measured quantities will result in the Thévenin impedance: ZTh \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 42 k\u0003 which also matches the longhand solution of Example 18.12: ZTh \u0001 (1 \u0002 m)R1 \u0001 (1 \u0002 20)2 k\u0005\u0001 (21)2 k\u0005 \u0001 42 k\u0003 The analysis of the full transistor equivalent network of Fig. 18.56 with two controlled sources can be found in the PSpice section of Chapter 26. 210 V \u00010°\u0003\u0003 5 mA \u00010° ETh\u0003 Isc Eoc\u0003 Isc COMPUTER ANALYSIS  837Th FIG. 18.108 The output ﬁle for the short-circuit current for the network of Fig. 18.107.

We will now examine the total power equa- tion in a slightly different form and will introduce two additional types of power: apparent and reactive. For any system such as in Fig. 19.1, the power delivered to a load at any instant is deﬁned by the product of the applied voltage and the resulting current; that is, p \u0001vi In this case, since v and i are sinusoidal quantities, let us establish a general case where v \u0001 Vm sin(qt \u0002 v) and i \u0001 Im sin qt The chosen v and i include all possibilities because, if the load is purely resistive, v \u0001 0°. If the load is purely inductive or capacitive, v \u0001 90° or v \u0001\u000390°, respectively. For a network that is primarily inductive, v is positive (v leads i), and for a network that is primarily capacitive, v is negative (i leads v). Pq s Load p v + – i FIG. 19.1 Deﬁning the power delivered to a load. Power (ac) 850  POWER (ac) Substituting the above equations for v and i into the power equation will result in p \u0001 Vm Im sin qt sin(qt \u0002 v) If we now apply a number of trigonometric identities, the following form for the power equation will result: (19.1) where V and I are the rms values. The conversion from peak values Vm and Im to rms values resulted from the operations performed using the trigonometric identities. It would appear initially that nothing has been gained by putting the equation in this form. However, the usefulness of the form of Eq. (19.1) will be demonstrated in the following sections. The derivation of Eq. (19.1) from the initial form will appear as an assignment at the end of the chapter. If Equation (19.1) is expanded to the form there are two obvious points that can be made. First, the average power still appears as an isolated term that is time independent. Second, both terms that follow vary at a frequency twice that of the applied voltage or current, with peak values having a very similar format. In an effort to ensure completeness and order in presentation, each basic element (R, L, and C) will be treated separately. 19.2 RESISTIVE CIRCUIT For a purely resistive circuit (such as that in Fig. 19.2), v and i are in phase, and v \u0001 0°, as appearing in Fig. 19.3. Substituting v \u0001 0° into Eq. (19.1), we obtain pR \u0001 VI cos(0°)(1 \u0003 cos 2qt) \u0002 VI sin(0°) sin 2qt \u0001 VI(1 \u0003 cos 2qt) \u0002 0 or (19.2) where VI is the average or dc term and \u0003VI cos 2qt is a negative cosine wave with twice the frequency of either input quantity (v or i) and a peak value of VI. Plotting the waveform for pR (Fig. 19.3), we see that T1 \u0001 period of input quantities T2 \u0001 period of power curve pR Note that in Fig. 19.3 the power curve passes through two cycles about its average value of VI for each cycle of either v or i (T1 \u0001 2T2 or f2 \u0001 2f1). Consider also that since the peak and average values of the power curve are the same, the curve is always above the horizontal axis. This indicates that the total power delivered to a resistor will be dissipated in the form of heat. pR \u0001 VI \u0003 VI cos 2qt p \u0001 VI cos v \u0003 VI cos v cos 2\u0004t \u0002 VI sin v sin 2\u0004t PeakAverage2x Peak 2x p \u0001 VI cos v(1 \u0003 cos 2qt) \u0002 VI sin v(sin 2qt) Pq s R + v –i pR FIG. 19.2 Determining the power delivered to a purely resistive load. APPARENT POWER  851 The power returned to the source is represented by the portion of the curve below the axis, which is zero in this case. The power dissipated by the resistor at any instant of time t1 can be found by simply substituting the time t1 into Eq. (19.2) to ﬁnd p1,as indicated in Fig. 19.3. The aver- age (real) power from Eq. (19.2), or Fig. 19.3, is VI; or, as a summary, (watts, W) (19.3) as derived in Chapter 14. The energy dissipated by the resistor (WR) over one full cycle of the applied voltage (Fig. 19.3) can be found using the following equation: W \u0001 Pt where P is the average value and t is the period of the applied voltage; that is, (joules, J) (19.4) or, since T1 \u0001 1/f1, (joules, J) (19.5) 19.3 APPARENT POWER From our analysis of dc networks (and resistive elements above), it would seem apparent that the power delivered to the load of Fig. 19.4 is simply determined by the product of the applied voltage and current, with no concern for the components of the load; that is, P \u0001 VI. How- ever, we found in Chapter 14 that the power factor (cos v) of the load will have a pronounced effect on the power dissipated, less pronounced for more reactive loads. Although the product of the voltage and current is not always the power delivered, it is a power rating of signiﬁcant use- WR \u0001 \u0005 V f1 I \u0005 WR \u0001 VIT1 P \u0001 VI \u0001 \u0005 Vm 2 Im\u0005 \u0001 I 2R \u0001 \u0005 V R 2 \u0005 Pq s Energy dissipated Energy dissipated (Average) VI VI t Power delivered to element by source Power returned to source by element T1 v it10 p1 pR T2 FIG. 19.3 Power versus time for a purely resistive load.

It is called the apparent power and is represented symbolically by S.* Since it is simply the product of voltage and current, its units are volt- amperes, for which the abbreviation is VA. Its magnitude is determined by (volt-amperes, VA) (19.6) or, since V \u0001 IZ and I \u0001 then (VA) (19.7) and (VA) (19.8) The average power to the load of Fig. 19.4 is P \u0001 VI cos v However, S \u0001 VI Therefore, (W) (19.9) and the power factor of a system Fp is (unitless) (19.10) The power factor of a circuit, therefore, is the ratio of the average power to the apparent power. For a purely resistive circuit, we have P \u0001 VI \u0001 S and Fp \u0001 cos v \u0001 \u0005 P S \u0005\u0001 1 In general, power equipment is rated in volt-amperes (VA) or in kilo- volt-amperes (kVA) and not in watts. By knowing the volt-ampere rat- ing and the rated voltage of a device, we can readily determine the max- imum current rating. For example, a device rated at 10 kVA at 200 V has a maximum current rating of I \u0001 10,000 VA/200 V \u0001 50 A when operated under rated conditions. The volt-ampere rating of a piece of equipment is equal to the wattage rating only when the Fp is 1. It is therefore a maximum power dissipation rating. This condition exists only when the total impedance of a system Z \u0001v is such that v \u0001 0°. The exact current demand of a device, when used under normal operating conditions, could be determined if the wattage rating and power factor were given instead of the volt-ampere rating. However, the power factor is sometimes not available, or it may vary with the load.

INDUCTIVE CIRCUIT AND REACTIVE POWER  853 The reason for rating some electrical equipment in kilovolt-amperes rather than in kilowatts can be described using the conﬁguration of Fig. 19.5. The load has an apparent power rating of 10 kVA and a current rating of 50 A at the applied voltage, 200 V. As indicated, the current demand of 70 A is above the rated value and could damage the load ele- ment, yet the reading on the wattmeter is relatively low since the load is highly reactive. In other words, the wattmeter reading is an indication of the watts dissipated and may not reﬂect the magnitude of the current drawn. Theoretically, if the load were purely reactive, the wattmeter reading would be zero even if the load was being damaged by a high current level.

Therefore, in Eq. (19.1), v \u0001 90°. Substitut- ing v \u0001 90° into Eq.

Note the absence of an average or constant term in the equation. Plotting the waveform for pL (Fig. 19.7), we obtain T1 \u0001 period of either input quantity T2 \u0001 period of pL curve Note that over one full cycle of pL (T2), the area above the horizontal axis in Fig. 19.7 is exactly equal to that below the axis. This indicates that over a full cycle of pL, the power delivered by the source to the inductor is exactly equal to that returned to the source by the inductor. The net ﬂow of power to the pure (ideal) inductor is zero over a full cycle, and no energy is lost in the transaction. The power absorbed or returned by the inductor at any instant of time t1 can be found simply by substituting t1 into Eq. (19.11). The peak value of the curve VI is deﬁned as the reactive power associated with a pure inductor. In general, the reactive power associated with any circuit is deﬁned to be VI sin v, a factor appearing in the second term of Eq. (19.1). Note that it is the peak value of that term of the total power equation that pro- duces no net transfer of energy. The symbol for reactive power is Q, and its unit of measure is the volt-ampere reactive (VAR).* The Q is derived from the quadrature (90°) relationship between the various powers, to be discussed in detail in a later section. Therefore, (volt-ampere reactive, VAR) (19.12) where v is the phase angle between V and I. For the inductor, (VAR) (19.13) or, since V \u0001 IXL or I \u0001 V/XL, (VAR) (19.14) or (VAR) (19.15) The apparent power associated with an inductor is S \u0001 VI, and the average power is P \u0001 0, as noted in Fig. 19.7.

INDUCTIVE CIRCUIT AND REACTIVE POWER  855 If the average power is zero, and the energy supplied is returned within one cycle, why is reactive power of any signiﬁcance? The reason is not obvious but can be explained using the curve of Fig. 19.7. At every instant of time along the power curve that the curve is above the axis (positive), energy must be supplied to the inductor, even though it will be returned during the negative portion of the cycle. This power requirement during the positive portion of the cycle requires that the generating plant provide this energy during that interval. Therefore, the effect of reactive elements such as the inductor can be to raise the power requirement of the generating plant, even though the reactive power is not dissipated but simply “borrowed.” The increased power demand during these intervals is a cost factor that must be passed on to the industrial consumer. In fact, most larger users of electrical energy pay for the apparent power demand rather than the watts dissipated since the volt-amperes used are sensitive to the reactive power require- ment (see Section 19.6). In other words, the closer the power factor of an industrial outﬁt is to 1, the more efﬁcient is the plant’s operation since it is limiting its use of “borrowed” power. The energy stored by the inductor during the positive portion of the cycle (Fig. 19.7) is equal to that returned during the negative portion and can be determined using the following equation: W \u0001 Pt where P is the average value for the interval and t is the associated interval of time. Recall from Chapter 14 that the average value of the positive portion of a sinusoid equals 2(peak value/p) and t \u0001 T2 /2. Therefore, WL \u0001 \u0001\u0002 \u0006 \u0001\u0002 and (J) (19.16) or, since T2 \u0001 1/f2, where f2 is the frequency of the pL curve, we have (J) (19.17) Since the frequency f2 of the power curve is twice that of the input quantity, if we substitute the frequency f1 of the input voltage or current, Equation (19.17) becomes WL \u0001 \u0005 p( V 2 I f1) \u0005 \u0001 However, V \u0001 IXL \u0001 Iq1L so that WL \u0001 \u0005 (Iq q 1 1 L)I \u0005 and (J) (19.18) providing an equation for the energy stored or released by the inductor in one half-cycle of the applied voltage in terms of the inductance and rms value of the current squared.

Therefore, in Eq. (19.1), v \u0001\u000390°. Substi- tuting v \u0001\u000390° into Eq.

The power delivered by the source to the capacitor is exactly equal to that returned to the source by the capacitor over one full cycle. The net ﬂow of power to the pure (ideal) capacitor is zero over a full cycle, and no energy is lost in the transaction. The power absorbed or returned by the capacitor at any instant of time t1 can be found by substituting t1 into Eq. (19.19). The reactive power associated with the capacitor is equal to the peak value of the pC curve, as follows: (VAR) (19.20) But, since V \u0001 IXC and I \u0001 V/XC, the reactive power to the capacitor can also be written (VAR) (19.21)QC \u0001 I 2XC QC \u0001 VI FIG. 19.9 The power curve for a purely capacitive load.

Proceeding in a manner similar to that used for the inductor, we can show that (J) (19.24) or, since T2 \u0001 1/f2, where f2 is the frequency of the pC curve, (J) (19.25) In terms of the frequency f1 of the input quantities v and i, WC \u0001\u0001 \u0001 and (J) (19.26) providing an equation for the energy stored or released by the capacitor in one half-cycle of the applied voltage in terms of the capacitance and rms value of the voltage squared. 19.6 THE POWER TRIANGLE The three quantities average power, apparent power, and reactive power can be related in the vector domain by (19.27) with P \u0001 P \u00010° QL \u0001 QL \u000190° QC \u0001 QC \u0001\u000390° For an inductive load, the phasor power S, as it is often called, is deﬁned by S \u0001 P \u0002 j QL S \u0001 P \u0002 Q WC \u0001 CV 2 V(Vq1C )\u0005\u0005 q1 VI \u0005 q1 VI\u0005 p(2f1) WC \u0001 \u0005 p V f I 2 \u0005 WC \u0001 \u0005 VI p T2 \u0005 S \u0001 VI Pq s858  POWER (ac) as shown in Fig. 19.10. The 90° shift in QL from P is the source of another term for reactive power: quadrature power. For a capacitive load, the phasor power S is deﬁned by S \u0001 P \u0003 j QC as shown in Fig. 19.11. If a network has both capacitive and inductive elements, the reactive component of the power triangle will be determined by the difference between the reactive power delivered to each. If QL > QC, the resultant power triangle will be similar to Fig. 19.10. If QC > QL, the resultant power triangle will be similar to Fig. 19.11. That the total reactive power is the difference between the reactive powers of the inductive and capacitive elements can be demonstrated by considering Eqs. (19.11) and (19.19). Using these equations, the reac- tive power delivered to each reactive element has been plotted for a series L-C circuit on the same set of axes in Fig. 19.12. The reactive elements were chosen such that XL > XC. Note that the power curve for each is exactly 180° out of phase. The curve for the resultant reactive power is therefore determined by the algebraic resultant of the two at each instant of time. Since the reactive power is deﬁned as the peak value, the reactive component of the power triangle is as indicated in the ﬁgure: I2(XL \u0003 XC).

An additional veriﬁcation can be derived by ﬁrst considering the impedance diagram of a series R-L-C circuit (Fig. 19.13). If we multi- ply each radius vector by the current squared (I 2), we obtain the results shown in Fig. 19.14, which is the power triangle for a predominantly inductive circuit. Since the reactive power and average power are always angled 90° to each other, the three powers are related by the Pythagorean theorem; that is, (19.28)S2 \u0001 P 2 \u0002 Q 2 qtVC I pC = –VC I sin 2qt QT VL I PL = VL I sin 2qt QT = QL – QC = VL I – VC I = I(VL – VC) = I(IXL – IXC) = I 2XL – I 2XC = I 2 (XL – XC) FIG. 19.12 Demonstrating why the net reactive power is the difference between that delivered to inductive and capacitive elements. + XL XC XL – XC Z R j FIG. 19.13 Impedance diagram for a series R-L-C circuit. 4 \u0002XL + – I V = 10 V 0° R 3 \u0002 FIG. 19.15 Demonstrating the validity of Eq.

It is particularly interesting that the equation (19.29) will provide the vector form of the apparent power of a system. Here, V is the voltage across the system, and I * is the complex conjugate of the current. Consider, for example, the simple R-L circuit of Fig. 19.15, where I \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001 2 A \u0001\u000353.13° The real power (the term real being derived from the positive real axis of the complex plane) is P \u0001 I 2R \u0001 (2 A)2(3 \u0007) \u0001 12 W and the reactive power is QL \u0001 I 2XL \u0001 (2 A) 2(4 \u0007) \u0001 16 VAR (L) with S \u0001 P \u0002 j QL \u0001 12 W \u0002 j 16 VAR (L) \u0001 20 VA \u000153.13° as shown in Fig. 19.16.

First, the total apparent power must be determined from the total average and reactive powers and cannot be determined from the apparent powers of each branch. Second, and more important, it is not necessary to con- sider the series-parallel arrangement of branches. In other words, the total real, reactive, or apparent power is independent of whether the loads are in series, parallel, or series-parallel.

Increased currents result in increased power losses (by a squared factor since P \u0001 I 2R) in the transmission lines due to the resistance of the lines. Heavier currents also require larger conductors, increasing the amount of copper needed for the system, and, quite obviously, they require increased generating capacities by the utility company. Every effort must therefore be made to keep current levels at a min- imum. Since the line voltage of a transmission system is ﬁxed, the apparent power is directly related to the current level. In turn, the smaller the net apparent power, the smaller the current drawn from the supply. Minimum current is therefore drawn from a supply when S \u0001 P and QT \u0001 0. Note the effect of decreasing levels of QT on the length (and magnitude) of S in Fig. 19.24 for the same real power. Note also that the power-factor angle approaches zero degrees and Fp approaches 1, revealing that the network is appearing more and more resistive at the input terminals. The process of introducing reactive elements to bring the power fac- tor closer to unity is called power-factor correction. Since most loads are inductive, the process normally involves introducing elements with capacitive terminal characteristics having the sole purpose of improving the power factor. In Fig. 19.25(a), for instance, an inductive load is drawing a current IL that has a real and an imaginary component. In Fig. 19.25(b), a capacitive load was added in parallel with the original load to raise the power factor of the total system to the unity power-factor level. Note that by placing all the elements in parallel, the load still receives the same terminal voltage and draws the same current IL. In other words, the load is unaware of and unconcerned about whether it is hooked up as shown in Fig. 19.25(a) or Fig. 19.25(b). 100 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 50 A \u0001\u000353.13° E \u0005 I 5000 VA\u0005 100 V Pq s FIG. 19.23 Example 19.4. v QT S Q T < QT S <S v <θ FIG. 19.24 Demonstrating the impact of power-factor correction on the power triangle of a network.

In addition, since the phase angle associated with both the applied voltage and the source cur- rent is the same, the system appears “resistive” at the input terminals, and all of the power supplied is absorbed, creating maximum efﬁciency for a generating utility.

The same meter can be used to measure the power in a dc or an ac network using the same con- nection strategy; in fact, it can be used to measure the wattage of any network with a periodic or a nonperiodic input. The digital display wattmeter of Fig. 19.30 employs a sophisticated electronic package to sense the voltage and current levels and, through the use of an analog-to-digital conversion unit, display the proper digits on the display. It is capable of providing a digital readout for distorted nonsinusoidal waveforms, and it can provide the phase power, total power, apparent power, reactive power, and power factor. When using a wattmeter, the operator must take care not to exceed the current, voltage, or wattage rating. The product of the voltage and current ratings may or may not equal the wattage rating. In the high- power-factor wattmeter, the product of the voltage and current ratings is usually equal to the wattage rating, or at least 80% of it. For a low- power-factor wattmeter, the product of the current and voltage ratings is much greater than the wattage rating. For obvious reasons, the low- power-factor meter is used only in circuits with low power factors (total impedance highly reactive). Typical ratings for high-power-factor (HPF) and low-power-factor (LPF) meters are shown in Table 19.2. Meters of both high and low power factors have an accuracy of 0.5% to 1% of full scale. 25.27 kVA\u0005\u0005 1000 V ST\u0005 E 1\u0005\u0005\u0005 (2p)(60 Hz)(156.74 \u0002) 1\u0005 2pfXC (10 3 V) 2 \u0005\u0005 6.38 \u0006 10 3 VAR E 2 \u0005 QC E 2 \u0005 XC Pq s FIG. 19.30 Digital wattmeter.

EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE  869 As the name implies, power-factor meters are designed to read the power factor of a load under operating conditions. Most are designed to be used on single- or three-phase systems. Both the voltage and the cur- rent are typically measured using nonintrusive methods; that is, con- nections are made directly to the terminals for the voltage measure- ments, whereas clamp-on current transformers are used to sense the current level, as shown for the power-factor meter of Fig. 19.31. Once the power factor is known, most power-factor meters come with a set of tables that will help deﬁne the power-factor capacitor that should be used to improve the power factor. Power-factor capacitors are typically rated in kVAR, with typical ratings extending from 1 to 25 kVAR at 240 V and 1 to 50 kVAR at 480 V or 600 V. 19.10 EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE The resistance of a conductor as determined by the equation R \u0001 r(l/A) is often called the dc, ohmic, or geometric resistance. It is a constant quantity determined only by the material used and its physical dimen- sions. In ac circuits, the actual resistance of a conductor (called the effective resistance) differs from the dc resistance because of the vary- ing currents and voltages that introduce effects not present in dc circuits. These effects include radiation losses, skin effect, eddy currents, and hysteresis losses. The ﬁrst two effects apply to any network, while the latter two are concerned with the additional losses introduced by the presence of ferromagnetic materials in a changing magnetic ﬁeld. Experimental Procedure The effective resistance of an ac circuit cannot be measured by the ratio V/I since this ratio is now the impedance of a circuit that may have both resistance and reactance. The effective resistance can be found, how- ever, by using the power equation P \u0001 I 2R, where (19.31) A wattmeter and an ammeter are therefore necessary for measuring the effective resistance of an ac circuit. Radiation Losses Let us now examine the various losses in greater detail. The radiation loss is the loss of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves during the transfer of energy from one element to another. This loss in energy R eff \u0001 \u0005 I P 2 \u0005 Pq s TABLE 19.2 Current Voltage Wattage Meter Ratings Ratings Ratings HPF 2.5 A 150 V 1500/750/375 5.0 A 300 V LPF 2.5 A 150 V 300/150/75 5.0 A 300 V FIG. 19.31 Clamp-on power-factor meter.

Eddy currents Coil Ferromagnetic core + – I E 870  POWER (ac) requires that the input power be larger to establish the same current I, causing R to increase as determined by Eq. (19.31). At a frequency of 60 Hz, the effects of radiation losses can be completely ignored. How- ever, at radio frequencies, this is an important effect and may in fact become the main effect in an electromagnetic device such as an antenna. Skin Effect The explanation of skin effect requires the use of some basic concepts previously described. Remember from Chapter 11 that a magnetic ﬁeld exists around every current-carrying conductor (Fig. 19.32). Since the amount of charge ﬂowing in ac circuits changes with time, the magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the moving charge (current) also changes. Recall also that a wire placed in a changing magnetic ﬁeld will have an induced voltage across its terminals as determined by Faraday’s law, e \u0001 N \u0006 (df/dt). The higher the frequency of the changing ﬂux as determined by an alternating current, the greater the induced voltage will be. For a conductor carrying alternating current, the changing magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the wire links the wire itself, thus developing within the wire an induced voltage that opposes the original ﬂow of charge or current. These effects are more pronounced at the center of the conduc- tor than at the surface because the center is linked by the changing ﬂux inside the wire as well as that outside the wire. As the frequency of the applied signal increases, the ﬂux linking the wire will change at a greater rate. An increase in frequency will therefore increase the counter-induced voltage at the center of the wire to the point where the current will, for all practical purposes, ﬂow on the surface of the con- ductor. At 60 Hz, the skin effect is almost noticeable. However, at radio frequencies the skin effect is so pronounced that conductors are fre- quently made hollow because the center part is relatively ineffective. The skin effect, therefore, reduces the effective area through which the current can ﬂow, and it causes the resistance of the conductor, given by the equation R↑ \u0001 r(l/A↓), to increase. Hysteresis and Eddy Current Losses As mentioned earlier, hysteresis and eddy current losses will appear when a ferromagnetic material is placed in the region of a changing magnetic ﬁeld. To describe eddy current losses in greater detail, we will consider the effects of an alternating current passing through a coil wrapped around a ferromagnetic core. As the alternating current passes through the coil, it will develop a changing magnetic ﬂux \b linking both the coil and the core that will develop an induced voltage within the core as determined by Faraday’s law. This induced voltage and the geometric resistance of the core RC \u0001 r(l/A) cause currents to be devel- oped within the core, icore \u0001 (eind /RC), called eddy currents. The cur- rents ﬂow in circular paths, as shown in Fig. 19.33, changing direction with the applied ac potential. The eddy current losses are determined by Peddy \u0001 i 2 eddyRcore The magnitude of these losses is determined primarily by the type of core used. If the core is nonferromagnetic—and has a high resistivity like wood or air—the eddy current losses can be neglected. In terms of the frequency of the applied signal and the magnetic ﬁeld strength pro- Pq s I Φ FIG. 19.32 Demonstrating the skin effect on the effective resistance of a conductor. FIG. 19.33 Deﬁning the eddy current losses of a ferromagnetic core. EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE  871 duced, the eddy current loss is proportional to the square of the fre- quency times the square of the magnetic ﬁeld strength: Peddy \u0002 f 2B 2 Eddy current losses can be reduced if the core is constructed of thin, laminated sheets of ferromagnetic material insulated from one another and aligned parallel to the magnetic ﬂux. Such construction reduces the magnitude of the eddy currents by placing more resistance in their path. Hysteresis losses were described in Section 11.8. You will recall that in terms of the frequency of the applied signal and the magnetic ﬁeld strength produced, the hysteresis loss is proportional to the fre- quency to the 1st power times the magnetic ﬁeld strength to the nth power: Phys \u0002 f 1Bn where n can vary from 1.4 to 2.6, depending on the material under con- sideration. Hysteresis losses can be effectively reduced by the injection of small amounts of silicon into the magnetic core, constituting some 2% or 3% of the total composition of the core. This must be done carefully, how- ever, because too much silicon makes the core brittle and difﬁcult to machine into the shape desired. EXAMPLE 19.7 a. An air-core coil is connected to a 120-V, 60-Hz source as shown in Fig. 19.34. The current is found to be 5 A, and a wattmeter reading of 75 W is observed.

As you travel further away from large urban communities, gasoline generators such as shown in Fig. 19.35 appear in increasing numbers in hardware stores, lumber yards, and other retail establishments to meet the needs of the local commu- nity. Since ac generators are driven by a gasoline motor, they must be properly ventilated and cannot be run indoors. Usually, because of the noise and fumes that result, they are placed as far away as possible and are connected by a long, heavy-duty, weather-resistant extension cord. Any connection points must be properly protected and placed to ensure that the connections will not sit in a puddle of water or be sensitive to heavy rain or snow. Although there is some effort involved in setting up generators and constantly ensuring that they have enough gas, most users will tell you that they are worth their weight in gold. 58.57 \u0002\u0005 377 rad/s XL\u0005 2pf 120 V\u0005 2 A E \u0005 I 52 \u0002\u0005 4 52 W\u0005 (2 A)2 P \u0005 I 2 80 \u0002\u0005 16 80 W\u0005 (4 A)2 P \u0005 I 2 23.81 \u0002\u0005 377 rad/s XL\u0005 2pf 120 V\u0005 5 A E \u0005 I 75 W\u0005 (5 A)2 P \u0005 I 2 Pq s FIG. 19.35 Single-phase portable generator.

At ﬁrst encounter, you might assume that you can run the world on 5000 W. However, keep in mind that the unit purchased should be rated at least 20% above your expected load because of surge currents that result when appliances, motors, tools, etc., are turned on. Remember that even a light bulb develops a large turn-on current due to the cold, low-resistance state of the ﬁlament. If you work too closely to the rated capacity, experiences such as a severe drop in lighting can result when an electric saw is turned on—almost to the point where it appears that the lights will go out altogether. Generators are like any other piece of equipment: If you apply a load that is too heavy, they will shut down. Most have protective fuses or circuit breakers to ensure that the excur- sions above rated conditions are monitored and not exceeded beyond reason. The 20% protective barrier drops the output power from a 5000-W unit to 4000 W, and already we begin to wonder about the load we can apply. Although 4000 W would be sufﬁcient to run a number of 60-W bulbs, a TV, an oil burner, and so on, troubles develop whenever a unit is hooked up for direct heating (such as heaters, hair dryers, and clothes dryers). Even microwaves at 1200 W command quite a power drain. Pile on a small electric heater at 1500 W with six 60-W bulbs (360 W), a 250-W TV, and a 250-W oil burner, and then turn on an electric hair dryer at 1500 W—suddenly you are very close to your maximum of 4000 W. It doesn’t take long to push the limits when it comes to energy-consuming appliances. Table 19.3 provides a list of speciﬁcations for the broad range of portable gasoline generators. Since the heaviest part of a generator is the gasoline motor, anything over 5 hp gets pretty heavy, especially when you add the weight of the gasoline. Most good units providing over 2400 W will have receptacles for 120 V and 220 V at various cur- rent levels, with an outlet for 12 V dc. They are also built so that they tolerate outdoor conditions of a reasonable nature and can run continu- ously for long periods of time. At 120 V, a 5000-W unit can provide a maximum current of about 42 A. Pq s TABLE 19.3 Speciﬁcations for portable gasoline-driven ac generators. Business Sense Because of the costs involved, every large industrial plant must contin- uously review its electric utility bill to ensure its accuracy and to con- sider ways that will keep it in check. As described in this chapter, the 874  POWER (ac) power factor associated with the plant as a whole can have a measur- able effect on the drain current and therefore the kVA drain on the power line. Power companies are aware of this problem and actually add a surcharge if the power factor fades below about 0.9. In other words, to ensure that the load appears as resistive in nature as possible, the power company is asking every user to try to ensure that his power factor is between 0.9 and 1 so that the kW demand is very close to the kVA demand. Power companies do give some leeway, but they don’t want it to get out of hand. Consider the following monthly bill for a fairly large industrial plant: kWh consumption 146.5 MWh peak kW demand 241.5 kW kW demand 233.5 kW kVA demand 250.5 kVA The rate schedule provided by the local power authority is the following: Energy First 450 kWh @ 22.3¢/kWh Next 12 MWh @ 17.1¢/kWh Additional kWh @ 8.9¢/kWh Power First 240 kW @ free Additional kW @ $12.05/kW Note that this rate schedule has an energy cost breakdown and a power breakdown. This second fee is the one sensitive to the overall power factor of the plant. The electric bill for the month is then calculated as follows: Cost \u0001 (450 kWh)(22.3¢/kWh) \u0004 (12 MWh)(17.1¢/kWh) \u0004 [146.2 MWh \u0003 (12 MWh \u0004 450 kWh)](8.9¢/kWh) \u0001 $100.35 \u0004 $2052.00 \u0004 $11,903.75 \u0001 $14,056.10 Before examining the effect of the power fee structure, we can ﬁnd the overall power factor of the load for the month with the following ratio taken from the monthly statement: Fp \u0001 \u0005 P P a \u0005\u0001 \u0005 2 2 5 3 0 3k k V W A\u0005 \u0001 0.932 Since the power factor is larger than 0.9, the chances are that there will not be a surcharge or that the surcharge will be minimal. When the power component of the bill is determined, the kVA demand is multiplied by the magic number of 0.9 to determine a kW level at this power factor. This kW level is compared to the metered level, and the consumer pays for the higher level. In this case, if we multiply the 250 kVA by 0.9, we obtain 225 kW which is slightly less than the metered level of 233 kW. However, both levels are less than the free level of 240 kW, so there is no additional charge for the power component. The total bill remains at $14,056.10. If the kVA demand of the bill were 388 kVA with the kW demand staying at 233 kW, the situation would change because 0.9 times 388 kVA would result in 349.2 kW which is much greater than the metered 233 kW. The 349.2 kW would then be used to determine the bill as follows: Pq sCOMPUTER ANALYSIS  875 349.2 kW \u0003 240 kW \u0001 109.2 kW (109.2 kW)($12.05/kW) \u0001 $1315.86 which is signiﬁcant. The total bill can then be determined as follows: Cost \u0001 $14,056.10 \u0004 $1,315.86 \u0001 $15,371.96 Thus, the power factor of the load dropped to 233 kW/388 kVA \u0001 0.6 which would put an unnecessary additional load on the power plant. It is certainly time to consider the power-factor-correction option as described in this text. It is not uncommon to see large capacitors sitting at the point where power enters a large industrial plant to perform a needed level of power-factor correction. All in all, therefore, it is important to fully understand the impact of a poor power factor on a power plant—whether you someday work for the supplier or for the consumer. 19.12 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Power Curve: Resistor The computer analysis will begin with a veriﬁcation of the curves of Fig. 19.3 which show the in-phase relation- ship between the voltage and current of a resistor. The ﬁgure shows that the power curve is totally above the horizontal axis and that the curve has a frequency twice the applied frequency and a peak value equal to twice the average value. First the simple schematic of Fig. 19.36 must Pq s FIG. 19.36 Using PSpice to review the power curve for a resistive element in an ac circuit. 876  POWER (ac) Pq s be set up. Then, using the Time Domain(Transient) option to get a plot versus time and setting the Run to time to 1 ms and the Maximum step size to 1 ms/1000 \u0001 1 ms, we select OK and then the Run PSpice icon to perform the simulation. Then Trace-Add Trace-V1(R) will result in the curve appearing in Fig. 19.37. Next, Trace-Add Trace- I(R) will result in the curve for the current as appearing in Fig. 19.37. Finally the power curve will be plotted using Trace-Add Trace- V1(R)*I(R) from the basic power equation, and the larger curve of Fig. 19.37 will result. The original plot had a y-axis that extended from \u000350 to \u000450. Since all of the data points are from \u000320 to \u000450, the y-axis was changed to this new range through Plot-Axis Settings-Y Axis- User Deﬁned-(\u000220 to \u000350)-OK to obtain the plot of Fig. 19.37. FIG. 19.37 The resulting plots for the power, voltage, and current for the resistor of Fig. 19.36. You can distinguish between the curves by simply looking at the symbol next to each quantity at the bottom left of the plot. In this case, however, to make it even clearer, a different color was selected for each trace by clicking on each trace with a right click, selecting Properties, and choosing the color and width of each curve. However, you can also add text to the screen by selecting the ABC icon to obtain the Text Label dialog box, entering the label such as P(R), and clicking OK. The label can then be placed anywhere on the screen. By selecting the Toggle cursor key and then clicking on I(R) at the bottom of the screen, we can use the cursor to ﬁnd the maximum value of the current. At A1 \u0001 250 ms or 1⁄4 of the total period of the input voltage, the cur- rent is a peak at 3.54 A. The peak value of the power curve can then be found by right-clicking on V1(R)*I(R), clicking on the graph, and then ﬁnding the peak value (also available by simply clicking on the Cursor COMPUTER ANALYSIS  877 Peak icon to the right of the Toggle cursor key). It occurs at the same point as the maximum current at a level of 50 W. In particular, note that the power curve shows two cycles, while both vR and iR show only one cycle. Clearly, the power curve has twice the frequency of the applied signal. Also note that the power curve is totally above the zero line, indicating that power is being absorbed by the resistor through the entire displayed cycle. Further, the peak value of the power curve is twice the average value of the curve; that is, the peak value of 50 W is twice the average value of 25 W. The results of the above simulation can be veriﬁed by performing the longhand calculation using the rms value of the applied voltage. That is, P \u0001 \u0005 V R R 2 \u0005\u0001 \u0005 (1 4 0 \u0002 V) 2 \u0005 \u0001 25 W Power Curves: Series R-L-C Circuit The network of Fig. 19.38, with its combination of elements, will now be used to demonstrate that, no matter what the physical makeup of the network, the average value of the power curve established by the product of the applied voltage and resulting source current is equal to that dissipated by the network. At a frequency of 1 kHz, the reactance of the 1.273-mH inductor will be 8, and the reactance of the capacitor will be 4 \u0002, resulting in a lagging network. An analysis of the network will result in ZT \u0001 4 \u0002\u0004 j4 \u0002\u0001 5.657 \u0002 \u000145° with I \u0001 \u0005 Z E T \u0005\u0001\u0001 1.768 A \u0001\u000345° and P \u0001 I 2R \u0001 (1.768 A)2 4 \u0002\u0001 12.5 W 10 V \u00010°\u0005\u0005 5.657 \u0002 \u000145° Pq s FIG. 19.38 Using PSpice to examine the power distribution in a series R-L-C circuit. Pq s The three curves of Fig. 19.39 were obtained using the Simulation Output Variables V(E:\u0003), I(R), and V(E:\u0003)*I(R). The Run to time under the Simulation Proﬁle listing was 20 ms, although 1 ms was cho- sen as the Maximum step size to ensure a good plot. In particular, note that the horizontal axis does not start until t \u0001 18 ms to ensure that we are in a steady-state mode and not in a transient stage (where the peak values of the waveforms could change with time). The horizontal axis was set to extend from 18 ms to 20 ms by simply selecting Plot-Axis Settings-X Axis-User Deﬁned-18ms to 20ms-OK. First note that the current lags the applied voltage as expected for the lagging network. The phase angle between the two is 45° as determined above. Second, be aware that the elements were chosen so that the same scale could be used for the current and voltage. The vertical axis does not have a unit of measurement, so the proper units must be mentally added for each plot. Using Plot-Label-Line, a line can be drawn across the screen at the average power level of 12.5 W. A pencil will appear that can be clicked in place at the left edge at the 12.5-W level. The pencil can then be dragged across the page to draw the desired line. Once you are at the right edge, remove the pressure on the mouse, and the line is drawn. The different colors for the traces were obtained simply by right- clicking on a trace and responding to the choices under Properties. Note that the 12.5-W level is indeed the average value of the power curve. It is interesting to note that the power curve dips below the axis for only a short period of time. In other words, during the two visible cycles, power is being absorbed by the circuit most of the time.

GLOSSARY Apparent power The power delivered to a load without con- sideration of the effects of a power-factor angle of the load. It is determined solely by the product of the terminal volt- age and current of the load. Average (real) power The delivered power dissipated in the form of heat by a network or system. Eddy currents Small, circular currents in a paramagnetic core causing an increase in the power losses and the effec- tive resistance of the material. Effective resistance The resistance value that includes the effects of radiation losses, skin effect, eddy currents, and hysteresis losses. Hysteresis losses Losses in a magnetic material introduced by changes in the direction of the magnetic ﬂux within the material. Power-factor correction The addition of reactive compo- nents (typically capacitive) to establish a system power fac- tor closer to unity. Radiation losses The loss of energy in the form of electro- magnetic waves during the transfer of energy from one ele- ment to another. Reactive power The power associated with reactive ele- ments that provides a measure of the energy associated with setting up the magnetic and electric ﬁelds of inductive and capacitive elements, respectively. Skin effect At high frequencies, a counter-induced voltage builds up at the center of a conductor, resulting in an increased ﬂow near the surface (skin) of the conductor and a sharp reduction near the center. As a result, the effective area of con- duction decreases and the resistance increases as deﬁned by the basic equation for the geometric resistance of a conductor. 20 20.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter will introduce the very important resonant (or tuned) circuit, which is fundamental to the operation of a wide variety of electrical and electronic systems in use today. The resonant circuit is a combination of R, L, and C elements having a frequency response characteristic similar to the one appearing in Fig. 20.1. Note in the ﬁgure that the response is a ƒr ffr V, I FIG. 20.1 Resonance curve. maximum for the frequency fr, decreasing to the right and left of this fre- quency. In other words, for a particular range of frequencies the response will be near or equal to the maximum. The frequencies to the far left or right have very low voltage or current levels and, for all practical pur- poses, have little effect on the system’s response. The radio or television receiver has a response curve for each broadcast station of the type indi- cated in Fig. 20.1. When the receiver is set (or tuned) to a particular sta- tion, it is set on or near the frequency fr of Fig. 20.1. Stations transmitting at frequencies to the far right or left of this resonant frequency are not car- ried through with signiﬁcant power to affect the program of interest. The tuning process (setting the dial to fr)as described above is the reason for Resonance 888  RESONANCE the terminology tuned circuit. When the response is at or near the maxi- mum, the circuit is said to be in a state of resonance. The concept of resonance is not limited to electrical or electronic systems. If mechanical impulses are applied to a mechanical system at the proper frequency, the system will enter a state of resonance in which sustained vibrations of very large amplitude will develop. The frequency at which this occurs is called the natural frequency of the system. The classic example of this effect was the Tacoma Narrows Bridge built in 1940 over Puget Sound in Washington State. Four months after the bridge, with its suspended span of 2800 ft, was com- pleted, a 42-mi/h pulsating gale set the bridge into oscillations at its nat- ural frequency. The amplitude of the oscillations increased to the point where the main span broke up and fell into the water below. It has since been replaced by the new Tacoma Narrows Bridge, completed in 1950. The resonant electrical circuit must have both inductance and capac- itance. In addition, resistance will always be present due either to the lack of ideal elements or to the control offered on the shape of the res- onance curve. When resonance occurs due to the application of the proper frequency (fr), the energy absorbed by one reactive element is the same as that released by another reactive element within the system. In other words, energy pulsates from one reactive element to the other. Therefore, once an ideal (pure C, L) system has reached a state of res- onance, it requires no further reactive power since it is self-sustaining. In a practical circuit, there is some resistance associated with the reac- tive elements that will result in the eventual “damping” of the oscilla- tions between reactive elements. There are two types of resonant circuits: series and parallel. Each will be considered in some detail in this chapter. SERIES RESONANCE 20.2 SERIES RESONANT CIRCUIT A resonant circuit (series or parallel) must have an inductive and a capacitive element. A resistive element will always be present due to the internal resistance of the source (Rs), the internal resistance of the inductor (Rl), and any added resistance to control the shape of the response curve (R design ). The basic conﬁguration for the series resonant circuit appears in Fig. 20.2(a) with the resistive elements listed above. The “cleaner” appearance of Fig. 20.2(b) is a result of combining the series resistive elements into one total value. That is, (20.1)R \u0001 Rs \u0002 Rl \u0002 Rd ƒr R L C – + Es ZT IRs Rd Rl L C Coil Source – + Es (a) (b) FIG. 20.2 Series resonant circuit.

The total impedance at resonance is then simply (20.3) representing the minimum value of ZT at any frequency. The subscript s will be employed to indicate series resonant conditions. The resonant frequency can be determined in terms of the induc- tance and capacitance by examining the deﬁning equation for resonance [Eq. (20.2)]: XL \u0001 XC Substituting yields qL \u0001 and q 2 \u0001 and (20.4) f \u0001 hertz (Hz) or fs \u0001 L \u0001 henries (H) (20.5) C \u0001 farads (F) The current through the circuit at resonance is I \u0001\u0001 \u00010° which you will note is the maximum current for the circuit of Fig. 20.2 for an applied voltage E since ZT is a minimum value. Consider also that the input voltage and current are in phase at resonance. Since the current is the same through the capacitor and inductor, the voltage across each is equal in magnitude but 180° out of phase at res- onance: VL \u0001 (I \u00010°)(XL \u000190°) \u0001 IXL \u000190° VC \u0001 (I \u00010°)(XC \u0001\u000390°) \u0001 IXC \u0001\u000390° and, since XL \u0001 XC, the magnitude of VL equals VC at resonance; that is, (20.6) Figure 20.3, a phasor diagram of the voltages and current, clearly indicates that the voltage across the resistor at resonance is the input voltage, and E, and I, and VR are in phase at resonance.

The power triangle at resonance (Fig. 20.4) shows that the total apparent power is equal to the average power dissipated by the resistor since QL \u0001 QC. The power factor of the circuit at resonance is Fp \u0001 cos v \u0001 and (20.7) Plotting the power curves of each element on the same set of axes (Fig. 20.5), we note that, even though the total reactive power at any instant is equal to zero (note that t \u0001 t ′), energy is still being absorbed and released by the inductor and capacitor at resonance.

A closer examination reveals that the energy absorbed by the induc- tor from time 0 to t1 is the same as the energy released by the capacitor from 0 to t1. The reverse occurs from t1 to t2, and so on. Therefore, the total apparent power continues to be equal to the average power, even though the inductor and capacitor are absorbing and releasing energy. This condition occurs only at resonance. The slightest change in fre- quency introduces a reactive component into the power triangle, which will increase the apparent power of the system above the average power dissipation, and resonance will no longer exist. 20.3 THE QUALITY FACTOR (Q ) The quality factor Q of a series resonant circuit is deﬁned as the ratio of the reactive power of either the inductor or the capacitor to the aver- age power of the resistor at resonance; that is, (20.8) The quality factor is also an indication of how much energy is placed in storage (continual transfer from one reactive element to the other) com- pared to that dissipated. The lower the level of dissipation for the same Qs \u0001 \u0004 r a e v a e c r t a i g v e e p p o o w w e e r r\u0004 THE QUALITY FACTOR (Q)  891 reactive power, the larger the Qs factor and the more concentrated and intense the region of resonance. Substituting for an inductive reactance in Eq. (20.8) at resonance gives us Qs \u0001 and (20.9) If the resistance R is just the resistance of the coil (Rl), we can speak of the Q of the coil, where R \u0001 Rl (20.10) Since the quality factor of a coil is typically the information provided by manufacturers of inductors, it is often given the symbol Q without an associated subscript. It would appear from Eq. (20.10) that Ql will increase linearly with frequency since XL \u0001 2pfL. That is, if the fre- quency doubles, then Ql will also increase by a factor of 2. This is approximately true for the low range to the midrange of frequencies such as shown for the coils of Fig. 20.6. Unfortunately, however, as the fre- quency increases, the effective resistance of the coil will also increase, due primarily to skin effect phenomena, and the resulting Ql will decrease. In addition, the capacitive effects between the windings will increase, further reducing the Ql of the coil. For this reason, Ql must be speciﬁed for a particular frequency or frequency range. For wide fre- quency applications, a plot of Ql versus frequency is often provided. The maximum Ql for most commercially available coils is less than 200, with most having a maximum near 100. Note in Fig. 20.6 that for coils of the same type, Ql drops off more quickly for higher levels of inductance. If we substitute qs \u0001 2pfs and then fs \u0001 into Eq. (20.9), we have Qs \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0003\u0004 L \u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0001 \u0003\u0004 and Qs \u0001 \u0004 R 1 \u0004\u0005 \u0004 C L \u0004\u0006 (20.11) providing Qs in terms of the circuit parameters. For series resonant circuits used in communication systems, Qs is usually greater than 1.

In fact, in many cases the Qs is so high that careful design and handling (including adequate insulation) are mandatory with respect to the voltage across the capacitor and inductor.

For frequencies less than fs, it is also quite clear that the network is primarily capacitive (XC > XL). For frequencies above the resonant condition, XL > XC, and the network is inductive.

The minimum impedance occurs at the resonant frequency and is equal to the resistance R. Note that the curve is not symmetrical about the resonant frequency (espe- cially at higher values of ZT). The phase angle associated with the total impedance is (20.15) For the tan\u00031 x function (resulting when XL > XC), the larger x is, the larger the angle v (closer to 90°). However, for regions where XC > XL, one must also be aware that (20.16) At low frequencies, XC > XL, and v will approach \u000390° (capacitive), as shown in Fig. 20.13, whereas at high frequencies, XL > XC, and v will approach 90°.

The curve is actually the inverse of the imped- ance-versus-frequency curve. Since the ZT curve is not absolutely sym- metrical about the resonant frequency, the curve of the current versus frequency has the same property. BW I Imax = E R 0.707Imax 0 f1 fs f2 f FIG. 20.14 I versus frequency for the series resonant circuit. There is a deﬁnite range of frequencies at which the current is near its maximum value and the impedance is at a minimum. Those fre- quencies corresponding to 0.707 of the maximum current are called the band frequencies, cutoff frequencies, or half-power frequencies. They are indicated by f1 and f2 in Fig. 20.14. The range of frequencies between the two is referred to as the bandwidth (abbreviated BW) of the resonant circuit. Half-power frequencies are those frequencies at which the power delivered is one-half that delivered at the resonant frequency; that is, (20.17)PHPF \u0001 \u0004 1 2 \u0004Pmax SELECTIVITY  895 The above condition is derived using the fact that Pmax \u0001 I 2 maxR and PHPF \u0001 I 2R \u0001 (0.707Imax) 2R \u0001 (0.5)(I 2 maxR) \u0001 Pmax Since the resonant circuit is adjusted to select a band of frequencies, the curve of Fig. 20.14 is called the selectivity curve. The term is derived from the fact that one must be selective in choosing the fre- quency to ensure that it is in the bandwidth. The smaller the bandwidth, the higher the selectivity. The shape of the curve, as shown in Fig. 20.15, depends on each element of the series R-L-C circuit. If the resis- tance is made smaller with a ﬁxed inductance and capacitance, the bandwidth decreases and the selectivity increases. Similarly, if the ratio L/C increases with ﬁxed resistance, the bandwidth again decreases with an increase in selectivity. In terms of Qs, if R is larger for the same XL, then Qs is less, as determined by the equation Qs \u0001 qs L/R. A small Qs, therefore, is associated with a resonant curve having a large bandwidth and a small selectivity, while a large Qs indicates the opposite. For circuits where Qs \u0006 10, a widely accepted approximation is that the resonant frequency bisects the bandwidth and that the resonant curve is symmetrical about the resonant frequency. These conditions are shown in Fig. 20.16, indicating that the cutoff fre- quencies are then equidistant from the resonant frequency. For any Qs, the preceding is not true. The cutoff frequencies f1 and f2 can be found for the general case (any Qs) by ﬁrst employing the fact that a drop in current to 0.707 of its resonant value corresponds to an increase in impedance equal to 1/0.707 \u0001 \u00012\u0002times the resonant value, which is R.

Note that the VR curve has the same shape as the I curve and a peak value equal to the magnitude of the input voltage E. The VC curve builds up slowly at ﬁrst from a value equal to the input voltage since the reactance of the capacitor is inﬁnite (open circuit) at zero frequency and the reactance of the inductor is zero (short circuit) at this frequency.

Therefore, VC rises and will continue to rise due to the quickly rising current, until the frequency nears resonance. As it approaches the resonant condition, the rate of change of I decreases. When this occurs, the factor 1/qC, which decreased as the frequency rose, will overcome the rate of change of I, and VC will start to drop. The peak value will occur at a frequency just before resonance. After resonance, both VC and I drop in magnitude, and VC approaches zero. The higher the Qs of the circuit, the closer fCmax will be to fs, and the closer VCmax will be to Qs E. For circuits with Qs ≥ 10, fCmax \t fs, and VCmax \t Qs E. The curve for VL increases steadily from zero to the resonant fre- quency since both quantities qL and I of the equation VL \u0001 IXL \u0001 (I)(qL) increase over this frequency range. At resonance, I has reached its maximum value, but qL is still rising. Therefore, VL will reach its maximum value after resonance. After reaching its peak value, the volt- age VL will drop toward E since the drop in I will overcome the rise in qL. It approaches E because XL will eventually be inﬁnite, and XC will be zero. 898  RESONANCE As Qs of the circuit increases, the frequency fLmax drops toward fs, and VLmax approaches QsE. For circuits with Qs ≥ 10, fLmax \t fs, and VLmax \t QsE. The VL curve has a greater magnitude than the VC curve for any fre- quency above resonance, and the VC curve has a greater magnitude than the VL curve for any frequency below resonance. This again veriﬁes that the series R-L-C circuit is predominantly capacitive from zero to the resonant frequency and predominantly inductive for any frequency above resonance. For the condition Qs ≥ 10, the curves of Fig. 20.17 will appear as shown in Fig. 20.18.

The parallel resonant circuit has the basic conﬁguration of Fig. 20.21, a parallel R-L-C com- bination in parallel with an applied current source. For the series circuit, the impedance was a minimum at resonance, producing a signiﬁcant current that resulted in a high output voltage for VC and VL. For the parallel resonant circuit, the impedance is relatively high at resonance, producing a signiﬁcant voltage for VC and VL through the Ohm’s law relationship (VC \u0001 IZT). For the network of Fig. 20.21, resonance will occur when XL \u0001 XC, and the resonant frequency will have the same format obtained for series resonance. If the practical equivalent of Fig. 20.21 had the format of Fig. 20.21, the analysis would be as direct and lucid as that experienced for series resonance. However, in the practical world, the internal resistance of the coil must be placed in series with the inductor, as shown in Fig. 20.22. The resistance Rl can no longer be included in a simple series or paral- lel combination with the source resistance and any other resistance added for design purposes. Even though Rl is usually relatively small in magnitude compared with other resistance and reactance levels of the network, it does have an important impact on the parallel resonant con- dition, as will be demonstrated in the sections to follow. In other words, the network of Fig. 20.21 is an ideal situation that can be assumed only for speciﬁc network conditions.

If we deﬁne the parallel combination of Rs and Rp by the notation (20.26) the network of Fig. 20.25 will result. It has the same format as the ideal conﬁguration of Fig. 20.21. We are now at a point where we can deﬁne the resonance condi- tions for the practical parallel resonant conﬁguration. Recall that for series resonance, the resonant frequency was the frequency at which the impedance was a minimum, the current a maximum, and the input impedance purely resistive, and the network had a unity power factor. For parallel networks, since the resistance Rp in our equivalent model is frequency dependent, the frequency at which maximum VC is obtained is not the same as required for the unity-power-factor char- acteristic. Since both conditions are often used to deﬁne the resonant state, the frequency at which each occurs will be designated by differ- ent subscripts.

Note also, how- ever, the absence of the source resistance Rs in Eqs. (20.30) and (20.31). Since the factor \u00011\u0002\u0003\u0002 (\u0002R\u0002 2 l C\u0002/L\u0002)\u0002is less than 1, fp is less than fs. Recog- nize also that as the magnitude of Rl approaches zero, fp rapidly approaches fs. Maximum Impedance, fm At f \u0001 fp the input impedance of a parallel resonant circuit will be near its maximum value but not quite its maximum value due to the frequency dependence of Rp. The frequency at which maximum impedance will occur is deﬁned by fm and is slightly more than fp,as demonstrated in Fig. 20.26. The frequency fm is determined by differ- entiating (calculus) the general equation for ZT with respect to fre- quency and then determining the frequency at which the resulting equation is equal to zero. The algebra is quite extensive and cumber- some and will not be included here. The resulting equation, however, is the following: fm \u0001 fs\u0005 1\u0006 \u0003\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0003\u0006\u0006\u0004\u0006 (20.32) Note the similarities with Eq. (20.31). Since the square-root factor of Eq. (20.32) is always more than the similar factor of Eq. (20.31), fm is always closer to fs and more than fp. In general, (20.33) Once fm is determined, the network of Fig. 20.25 can be used to determine the magnitude and phase angle of the total impedance at the resonance condition simply by substituting f \u0001 fm and performing the required calculations. That is, f \u0001 fm (20.34) 20.9 SELECTIVITY CURVE FOR PARALLEL RESONANT CIRCUITS The ZT -versus-frequency curve of Fig. 20.26 clearly reveals that a par- allel resonant circuit exhibits maximum impedance at resonance ( fm), unlike the series resonant circuit, which experiences minimum resis- tance levels at resonance. Note also that ZT is approximately Rl at f \u0001 0 Hz since ZT \u0001 Rs \u0001 Rl \t Rl. Since the current I of the current source is constant for any value of ZT or frequency, the voltage across the parallel circuit will have the same shape as the total impedance ZT, as shown in Fig. 20.27. For the parallel circuit, the resonance curve of interest is that of the voltage VC across the capacitor. The reason for this interest in VC derives from electronic considerations that often place the capacitor at the input to another stage of a network.

SELECTIVITY CURVE FOR PARALLEL RESONANT CIRCUITS  905 Since the voltage across parallel elements is the same, (20.35) The resonant value of VC is therefore determined by the value of ZTm and the magnitude of the current source I. The quality factor of the parallel resonant circuit continues to be determined by the ratio of the reactive power to the real power. That is, Qp \u0001 where R \u0001 Rs \u0001 Rp, and Vp is the voltage across the parallel branches. The result is Qp \u0001 \u0004 X R Lp \u0004 \u0001 (20.36a) or since XLp \u0001 XC at resonance, Qp \u0001 (20.36b) For the ideal current source (Rs \u0001 ∞ \u0005) or when Rs is sufﬁciently large compared to Rp, we can make the following approximation: R \u0001 Rs Rp \t Rp and Qp \u0001\u0001 \u0001 so that Qp \u0001 \u0004 X R L l \u0004 \u0001 Ql Rs k Rp (20.37) which is simply the quality factor Ql of the coil. In general, the bandwidth is still related to the resonant frequency and the quality factor by BW \u0001 f2 \u0003 f1 \u0001 \u0004 Q fr p \u0004 (20.38) The cutoff frequencies f1 and f2 can be determined using the equiva- lent network of Fig. 20.25 and the unity power condition for resonance. The half-power frequencies are deﬁned by the condition that the output voltage is 0.707 times the maximum value. However, for parallel reso- nance with a current source driving the network, the frequency response for the driving point impedance is the same as that for the output volt- age. This similarity permits deﬁning each cutoff frequency as the fre- quency at which the input impedance is 0.707 times its maximum value. Since the maximum value is the equivalent resistance R of Fig. 20.25, the cutoff frequencies will be associated with an impedance equal to 0.707R or (1/\u00012\u0002)R.

Whether or not Rl is zero, the parallel resonant circuit will frequently appear in a network schematic as shown in Fig. 20.28. At resonance, an increase in Rl or a decrease in the ratio L/C will result in a decrease in the resonant impedance, with a corresponding increase in the current. The bandwidth of the resonance curves is given by Eq. (20.38). For increasing Rl or decreasing L (or L/C for constant C), the bandwidth will increase as shown in Fig. 20.28. At low frequencies, the capacitive reactance is quite high, and the inductive reactance is low. Since the elements are in parallel, the total impedance at low frequencies will therefore be inductive. At high fre- quencies, the reverse is true, and the network is capacitive. At reso- nance ( fp), the network appears resistive. These facts lead to the phase plot of Fig. 20.29. Note that it is the inverse of that appearing for the series resonant circuit because at low frequencies the series resonant circuit was capacitive and at high frequencies it was inductive. ƒr Rl3 ffr0 Rl3 > Rl2 > Rl1 L/C fixed Zp Rl1 Rl2 Rl ffr0 Zp L3 C3 L2 C2 L1 C1 >> Rl fixed L3/C3 L2/C2 L1/C1 FIG. 20.28 Effect of Rl, L, and C on the parallel resonance curve. 20.10 EFFECT OF Ql ≥ 10 The content of the previous section may suggest that the analysis of parallel resonant circuits is signiﬁcantly more complex than encoun- tered for series resonant circuits.

For large Ql, the current IC can be signiﬁcant. A similar derivation results in Ql ≥ 10 (20.57) Conclusions The equations resulting from the application of the condition Ql ≥ 10 are obviously a great deal easier to apply than those obtained earlier. It is, therefore, a condition that should be checked early in an analysis to determine which approach must be applied. Although the condition Ql ≥ 10 was applied throughout, many of the equations are still good approximations for Ql < 10. For instance, if Ql \u0001 5, XLp \u0001 (XL/Q 2 l ) \u0003 Xl \u0001 (XL/25) \u0003 XL \u0001 1.04XL, which is very close to XL.Infact, for Ql \u0001 2, XLp \u0001 (XL/4) \u0003 XL \u0001 1.25XL, which agreeably is not XL, but it is only 25% off. In general, be aware that the approximate equations can be applied with good accuracy with Ql < 10. The smaller the level of Ql, however, the less valid the approximation. The approximate equa- tions are certainly valid for a range of values of Ql < 10 if a rough approximation to the actual response is desired rather than one accurate to the hundredths place. 20.11 SUMMARY TABLE In an effort to limit any confusion resulting from the introduction of fp and fm and an approximate approach dependent on Ql, summary Table 20.1 was developed.

For the future, the analysis of a parallel resonant network might pro- ceed as follows: 1. Determine fs to obtain some idea of the resonant frequency. Recall that for most situations, fs, fm, and fp will be relatively close to each other. 2. Calculate an approximate Ql using fs from above, and compare it to the condition Ql ≥ 10. If the condition is satisﬁed, the approx- imate approach should be the chosen path unless a high degree of accuracy is required. 3. If Ql is less than 10, the approximate approach can be applied, but it must be understood that the smaller the level of Ql, the less accurate the solution. However, considering the typical variations from nameplate values for many of our components and that a resonant frequency to the tenths place is seldom required, the use of the approximate approach for many practical situations is usu- ally quite valid. 20.12 EXAMPLES (PARALLEL RESONANCE) EXAMPLE 20.6 Given the parallel network of Fig. 20.32 composed of “ideal” elements: a.

APPLICATIONS  919 20.13 APPLICATIONS Stray Resonance Stray resonance, like stray capacitance and inductance and unexpected resistance levels, can occur in totally unexpected situations and can severely affect the operation of a system. All that is required to produce stray resonance would be, for example, a level of capacitance intro- duced by parallel wires or copper leads on a printed circuit board, or simply two parallel conductive surfaces with residual charge and induc- tance levels associated with any conductor or components such as tape recorder heads, transformers, and so on, that provide the elements nec- essary for a resonance effect. In fact, this resonance effect is a very common effect in the everyday cassette tape recorder. The play/record head is a coil that can act like an inductor and an antenna. Combine this factor with the stray capacitance and real capacitance in the network to form the tuning network, and the tape recorder with the addition of a semiconductor diode can respond like an AM radio. As you plot the fre- quency response of any transformer, you will normally ﬁnd a region where the response has a peaking effect (look ahead at Fig. 25.23). This peaking is due solely to the inductance of the coils of the transformer and the stray capacitance between the wires. In general, any time you see an unexpected peaking in the frequency response of an element or a system, it is normally caused by a reso- nance condition. If the response has a detrimental effect on the overall operation of the system, a redesign may be in order, or a ﬁlter can be added that will block the frequencies that result in the resonance condi- tion. Of course, when you add a ﬁlter composed of inductors and/or capacitors, you must be careful that you don’t add another unexpected resonance condition. It is a problem that can be properly weighed only by constructing the system and exposing it to the full range of tests. Graphic and Parametric Equalizers We have all noticed at one time or another that the music we hear in a concert hall doesn’t quite sound the same when we play it at home on our entertainment center. Even after we check the speciﬁcations of the speakers and ampliﬁers and ﬁnd that both are nearly perfect (and the most expensive we can afford), the sound is still not what it should be. In general, we are experiencing the effects of the local environmental characteristics on the sound waves. Some typical problems are hard walls or ﬂoors (stone, cement) that will make high frequencies sound louder. Curtains and rugs, on the other hand, will absorb high frequen- cies. The shape of the room and the placement of the speakers and fur- niture will also affect the sound that reaches our ears. Another criterion is the echo or reﬂection of sound that will occur in the room. Concert halls are designed very carefully with their vaulted ceilings and curved walls to allow a certain amount of echo. Even the temperature and humidity characteristics of the surrounding air will affect the quality of the sound. It is certainly impossible, in most cases, to redesign your lis- tening area to match a concert hall, but with the proper use of electronic systems you can develop a response that will have all the qualities that you can expect from a home entertainment center. For a quality system a number of steps can be taken: characteriza- tion and digital delay (surround sound) and proper speaker and ampli- ƒr920  RESONANCE ƒr FIG. 20.40 (a) Dual-channel 15-band “Constant Q” graphic equalizer (Courtesy of ARX Systems.); (b) setup; (c) frequency response.

Characterization is a process whereby a thorough sound absorption check of the room is performed and the fre- quency response determined. A graphic equalizer such as appearing in Fig. 20.40(a) is then used to make the response “ﬂat” for the full range of frequencies. In other words, the room is made to appear as though all the frequencies receive equal ampliﬁcation in the listening area. For instance, if the room is fully carpeted with full draping curtains, there will be a lot of high-frequency absorption, requiring that the high fre- quencies have additional ampliﬁcation to match the sound levels of the mid and low frequencies. To characterize the typical rectangular-shaped room, a setup such as shown in Fig. 20.40(b) may be used. The ampli- ﬁer and speakers are placed in the center of one wall, with additional speakers in the corners of the room facing the reception area. A mike is then placed in the reception area about 10 ft from the ampliﬁer and cen- tered between the two other speakers. A pink noise will then be sent out from a spectrum analyzer (often an integral part of the graphic equal- izer) to the ampliﬁer and speakers. Pink noise is actually a square-wave signal whose amplitude and frequency can be controlled. A square- wave signal was chosen because a Fourier breakdown of a square-wave signal will result in a broad range of frequencies for the system to check. You will ﬁnd in Chapter 24 that a square wave can be con- structed of an inﬁnite series of sine waves of different frequencies. Once the proper volume of pink noise is established, the spectrum ana- lyzer can be used to set the response of each slide band to establish the desired ﬂat response. The center frequencies for the slides of the graphic equalizer of Fig. 20.40(a) are provided in Fig. 20.40(c), along with the frequency response for a number of adjoining frequencies evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale. Note that each center frequency is actually the resonant frequency for that slide. The design is such that each slide can control the volume associated with that frequency, but the bandwidth and frequency response stay fairly constant. A good spectrum analyzer will have each slide set against a decibel (dB) scale (decibels will be discussed in detail in Chapter 23). The decibel scale simply establishes a scale for the comparison of audio levels. At a nor- mal listening level, usually a change of about 3 dB is necessary for the audio change to be detectable by the human ear. At low levels of sound, a 2-dB change may be detectable, but at loud sounds probably a 4-dB change would be necessary for the change to be noticed. These are not strict laws but simply rules of thumb commonly used by audio techni- cians. For the room in question, the mix of settings may be as shown in Fig. 20.40(c). Once set, the slides are not touched again. A ﬂat response has been established for the room for the full audio range so that every sound or type of music is covered. A parametric equalizer such as appearing in Fig. 20.41 is similar to a graphic equalizer, but instead of separate controls for the individual frequency ranges, it uses three basic controls over three or four broader frequency ranges. The typical controls—the gain, center frequency, and ƒr FIG. 20.41 Six-channel parametric equalizer. (Courtesy of ARX Systems.) 922  RESONANCE bandwidth—are typically available for the low-, mid-, and high- frequency ranges. Each is fundamentally an independent control; that is, a change in one can be made without affecting the other two. For the parametric equalizer of Fig. 20.41, each of the six channels has a fre- quency control switch which, in conjunction with the f \b10 switch, will give a range of center frequencies from 40 Hz through 16 kHz. It has controls for BW (“Q”) from 3 octaves to 1⁄20 octave, and \u000518 dB cut and boost. Some like to refer to the parametric equalizer as a sophisticated tone control and will actually use them to enrich the sound after the ﬂat response has been established by the graphic equalizer. The effect achieved with a standard tone control knob is sometimes referred to as “boring” compared to the effect established by a good parametric equal- izer, primarily because the former can control only the volume and not the bandwidth or center frequency. In general, graphic equalizers estab- lish the important ﬂat response while parametric equalizers are adjusted to provide the type and quality of sound you like to hear. You can “notch out” the frequencies that bother you and remove tape “hiss” and the “sharpness” often associated with CDs. One characteristic of concert halls that is more difﬁcult to fake is the fullness of sound that concert halls are able to provide. In the concert hall you have the direct sound from the instruments and the reﬂection of sound off the walls and the vaulted ceilings which were all carefully designed expressly for this purpose. Any reﬂection results in a delay in the sound waves reaching the ear, creating the fullness effect. Through digital delay, speakers can be placed to the back and side of a listener to establish the surround sound effect. In general, the delay speakers are much lower in wattage, with 20-W speakers typically used with a 100-W system. The echo response is one reason that people often like to play their stereos louder than they should for normal hearing. By playing the stereo louder, they create more echo and reﬂection off the walls, bring- ing into play some of the fullness heard at concert halls. It is probably safe to say that any system composed of quality com- ponents, a graphic and parametric equalizer, and surround sound will have all the components necessary to have a quality reproduction of the concert hall effect. 20.14 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Series Resonance This chapter provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate what computer software programs can do for us. Imag- ine having to plot a detailed resonance curve with all the calculations required for each frequency. At every frequency, the reactance of the inductive and capacitive elements changes, and the phasor operations would have to be repeated—a long and arduous task. However, with PSpice, taking a few moments to enter the circuit and establish the desired simulation will result in a detailed plot in a few seconds that can have plot points every microsecond! For the ﬁrst time, the horizontal axis will be in the frequency domain rather than in the time domain as in all the previous plots. For the series resonant circuit of Fig. 20.42, the magnitude of the source was chosen to produce a maximum current of I \u0001 400 mV/40 \u0001 \u0001 10 mA at reso- nance, and the reactive elements will establish a resonant frequency of ƒrCOMPUTER ANALYSIS  923 fs \u0001\u0001 \t 2.91 kHz The quality factor is Ql \u0001 \u0002 X R L l \u0002\u0001 \u0002 54 4 6 0 .6 \u0006 4 \u0006\u0002 \t 13.7 which is relatively high and should give us a nice sharp response.

All the parameters were set by double-clicking on the source symbol and entering the values in the Property Editor dialog box. For each, Name and Value was selected under Display followed by Apply before leaving the dialog box. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, AC Sweep/Noise was selected, and the Start Frequency was set at 1 kHz, the End Fre- quency at 10 kHz, and the Points/Decade at 10,000. The Logarithmic scale and Decade settings remain at their default values. The 10,000 for Points/Decade was chosen to ensure a number of data points near the peak value. When the SCHEMATIC1 screen of Fig. 20.43 appears, Trace-Add Trace-I(R)-OK will result in a logarithmic plot that peaks just to the left of 3 kHz. The spacing between grid lines on the X-axis should be increased, so Plot-Axis Settings-X Grid-unable Automatic- Spacing-Log-0.1-OK is implemented. Next, select the Toggle cursor 1\u0002\u0002\u0002 2p\u0001(3\u00020\u0002m\u0002H\u0002)(\u00020\u0002.1\u0002m\u0002F\u0002)\u0002 1\u0002 2p\u0001L\u0002C\u0002 ƒr FIG. 20.42 Series resonant circuit to be analyzed using PSpice. 924  RESONANCE icon, and with a right click of the mouse move the right cursor as close to 7.07 mA as possible (0.707 of the peak value to deﬁne the band- width) to obtain A1 with a frequency of 3.02 kHz at a level of 7.01 mA— the best we can do with the 10,000 data points per decade. Now do a left click, and place the left cursor as close to the same level as possi- ble. The result is 2.8 kHz at a level of 7.07 mA for A2. The cursors were set in the order above to obtain a positive answer for the difference of the two as appearing in the third line of the Probe Cursor box. The resulting 214.22 Hz is an excellent match with the calculated value of 212 Hz. Parallel Resonance Let us now investigate the parallel resonant cir- cuit of Fig. 20.33 and compare the results with the longhand solution. The network appears in Fig. 20.44 using ISRC as the ac source voltage. Under the Property Editor heading, the following values were set: DC \u0001 0A, AC \u0001 2 mA, and TRAN \u0001 0. Under Display, Do Not Display was selected for both DC and TRAN since they do not play a part in our analysis. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, AC Sweep/ Noise was selected, and the Start Frequency was selected as 10 kHz since we know that it will resonate near 30 kHz. The End Frequency was chosen as 100 kHz for a ﬁrst run to see the results. The Points/ Decade was set at 10,000 to ensure a good number of data points for the peaking region. After simulation, Trace-Add Trace-V(C:1)-OK resulted in the plot of Fig. 20.45 with a resonant frequency near 30 kHz. The selected range appears to be a good one, but the initial plot needed more grid lines on the x-axis, so Plot-Axis Settings-X-Grid-unenable Automatic-Spacing-Log-0.1-OK was used to obtain a grid line at 10-kHz intervals. Next the Toggle cursor pad was selected and a left-click ƒr FIG. 20.43 Resonance curve for the current of the circuit of Fig. 20.42.

The Cursor Peak pad was then cho- sen to ﬁnd the peak value of the curve. The result was A1 \u0001 319.45 mV at 28.94 kHz which is a very close match with the calculated value of 318.68 mV at 28.57 kHz for the maximum value of VC. The bandwidth is deﬁned at a level of 0.707(319.45 mV) \u0001 225.85 mV. Using the right-click cursor, we ﬁnd that the closest we can come is 224.72 mV for the 10,000 points of data per decade. The resulting frequency is 34.69 kHz as shown in the Probe Cursor box of Fig. 20.45. We can now use the left-click cursor to ﬁnd the same level to the left of the peak value so that we can determine the bandwidth. The closest that the left-click cursor can come to 225.85 mV is 224.96 mV at a fre- quency of 23.97 kHz. The bandwidth will then appear as 10.72 kHz in the Probe Cursor box, comparing very well with the longhand solution of 10.68 kHz in Example 20.7. It would now be interesting to look at the phase angle of the voltage across the parallel network to ﬁnd the frequency when the network appears resistive and the phase angle is 0°. First use Trace-Delete All Traces, and call up P(V(C:1)) followed by OK. The result is the plot of Fig. 20.46, revealing that the phase angle is close to \u000490° at very high frequencies as the capacitive element with its decreasing reactance takes over the characteristics of the parallel network. At 10 kHz the inductive element has a lower reactance than the capacitive element, and the network has a positive phase angle. Using the cursor option, we can move the left click along the horizontal axis until the phase angle is at its minimum value. As shown in Fig. 20.46, the smallest angle avail- able with the determined data points is 49.86 mdegrees \u0001 0.05° which is certainly very close to 0°. The corresponding frequency is 27.046 kHz which is essentially an exact match with the longhand solution of ƒr FIG. 20.46 Phase plot for the voltage vC for the parallel resonant network of Fig. 20.44. COMPUTER ANALYSIS  927 27.051 kHz. Clearly, therefore, the frequency at which the phase angle is zero and the total impedance appears resistive is less than the fre- quency at which the output voltage is a maximum. Electronics Workbench The results of Example 20.9 will now be conﬁrmed using Electronics Workbench. The network of Fig. 20.36 will appear as shown in Fig. 20.47 after all the elements have been placed as described in earlier chapters. In particular, note that the frequency assigned to the 2-mA ac current source is 100 kHz. Since we have some idea that the resonant frequency is a few hundred kilohertz, it seemed appropriate that the starting frequency for the plot begin at 100 kHz and extend to 1 MHz. Also, be sure that the AC Magnitude is set to 2 mA in the Analysis Setup within the AC Current dialog box. ƒr FIG. 20.47 Using Electronics Workbench to conﬁrm the results of Example 20.9. For simulation, the sequence Simulate-Analyses-AC Analysis is ﬁrst selected to obtain the AC Analysis dialog box. The Start fre- quency is set at 100 kHz, and the Stop frequency at 1 MHz; Sweep type is Decade; Number of points per decade is 1000; and the Verti- cal scale is Linear. Under Output variables, node number 1 is selected as a Variable for analysis followed by Simulate to run the program. The results are the magnitude and phase plots of Fig. 20.48. Starting with the Voltage plot, the Show/Hide Grid key, Show/Hide Legend key, and Show/Hide Cursors key are selected. You will immediately note under the AC Analysis cursor box that the maximum value is 95.24 V and the minimum value is 6.94 V. By moving the cursor until we reach 95.24 V (y1), the resonant frequency can be found. As shown 928  RESONANCE in the top cursor dialog box of Fig. 20.48, this is achieved at 318.42 kHz (x1). The other (blue) cursor can be used to deﬁne the high cutoff frequency for the bandwidth by ﬁrst calculating the 0.707 level of the output voltage. The result is 0.707(95.24 V) \u0001 67.33 V. The closest we can come to this level with the cursor is 66.43 V (y2) which deﬁnes a frequency of 354.81 kHz (x2). If we now use the red cursor to ﬁnd the corresponding level below the resonant frequency, we will ﬁnd a level of 67.49 V (y1) at 287.08 kHz (x1). The resulting bandwidth is there- fore 354.81 kHz \u0004 287.08 kHz \u0001 67.73 kHz. It would now be interesting to determine the resonant frequency if we deﬁne resonance as that frequency that results in a phase angle of 0° for the output voltage. By repeating the process described above for the phase plot, we can set the red cursor as close to 0° as possible. The result is 1.04° (y1) at 317.69 kHz (x1), clearly revealing that the resonant fre- quency deﬁned by the phase angle is less than that deﬁned by the peak voltage. However, with a Ql of about 100, the difference of 0.73 kHz (less than 1 kHz) is not signiﬁcant. Also note that when the second cur- sor was set on approximately 1 MHz (997.7 kHz), the phase angle of \u000485.91° is very close to that of a pure capacitor. The shorting effect of a capacitor at high frequencies has taken over the characteristics of the parallel resonant circuit. Again, the computer solution was a very close match with the long- hand solution of Example 20.9 with a perfect match of 95.24 V for the peak value and only a small difference in bandwidth with 66.87 kHz in Example 20.9 and 67.73 kHz here. For the high cutoff frequency, the computer generated a result of 354.8 kHz, while the theoretical solution was 351.7 kHz. For the low cutoff frequency, the computer responded with 287.08 kHz compared to a theoretical solution of 284 kHz. ƒr FIG. 20.48 Magnitude and phase plots for the voltage vC of the network of Fig. 20.47.

We shall now exam- ine the mutual inductance that exists between coils of the same or dif- ferent dimensions. Mutual inductance is a phenomenon basic to the operation of the transformer, an electrical device used today in almost every ﬁeld of electrical engineering. This device plays an integral part in power distribution systems and can be found in many electronic cir- cuits and measuring instruments. In this chapter, we will discuss three of the basic applications of a transformer: to build up or step down the voltage or current, to act as an impedance matching device, and to iso- late (no physical connection) one portion of a circuit from another. In addition, we will introduce the dot convention and will consider the transformer equivalent circuit. The chapter will conclude with a word about writing mesh equations for a network with mutual inductance. 21.2 MUTUAL INDUCTANCE A transformer is constructed of two coils placed so that the changing ﬂux developed by one will link the other, as shown in Fig. 21.1.

Transformers 936  TRANSFORMERS will result in an induced voltage across each coil. To distinguish between the coils, we will apply the transformer convention that the coil to which the source is applied is called the primary, and the coil to which the load is applied is called the secondary. For the primary of the transformer of Fig. 21.1, an application of Fara- day’s law [Eq. (12.1)] will result in (volts, V) (21.1) revealing that the voltage induced across the primary is directly related to the number of turns in the primary and the rate of change of mag- netic ﬂux linking the primary coil. Or, from Eq. (12.5), (volts, V) (21.2) revealing that the induced voltage across the primary is also directly related to the self-inductance of the primary and the rate of change of current through the primary winding. The magnitude of es, the voltage induced across the secondary, is determined by (volts, V) (21.3) where Ns is the number of turns in the secondary winding and fm is the portion of the primary ﬂux fp that links the secondary winding. If all of the ﬂux linking the primary links the secondary, then fm \u0001 fp and (volts, V) (21.4) The coefﬁcient of coupling (k) between two coils is determined by (21.5) Since the maximum level of fm is fp, the coefﬁcient of coupling between two coils can never be greater than 1. The coefﬁcient of coupling between various coils is indicated in Fig. 21.2. In Fig. 21.2(a), the ferromagnetic steel core will ensure that most of the ﬂux linking the primary will also link the secondary, establishing a coupling coefﬁcient very close to 1. In Fig. 21.2(b), the fact that both coils are overlapping will result in the ﬂux of one coil linking the other coil, with the result that the coefﬁcient of coupling is again very close to 1. In Fig. 21.2(c), the absence of a ferromagnetic core will result in low levels of ﬂux linkage between the coils. The closer the two coils are, the greater the ﬂux linkage, and the higher the value of k, although k (coefﬁcient of coupling) \u0001 \u0002 f f m p \u0002 es \u0001 Ns \u0002 d d f t p \u0002 es \u0001 Ns \u0002 d d f t m \u0002 ep \u0001 Lp \u0002 d d i t p \u0002 ep \u0001 Np \u0002 d d f t p \u0002 +–es +–ep mφ Any core (b) k ≅ 1 Air core +–ep +–es k = << 1 (0.01 0.3) pφ mφ mφ 1φ (c) Steel core + ep – + es – pφ mφ ≅ (a) k ≅ 1 FIG. 21.2 Windings having different coefﬁcients of coupling.

For the secondary, we have es \u0001 Ns \u0001 Ns and (volts, V) (21.6) The mutual inductance between the two coils of Fig. 21.1 is deter- mined by (henries, H) (21.7) or (henries, H) (21.8) Note in the above equations that the symbol for mutual inductance is the capital letter M and that its unit of measurement, like that of self-inductance, is the henry. In words, Equations (21.7) and (21.8) state that the mutual inductance between two coils is proportional to the instantaneous change in ﬂux linking one coil due to an instantaneous change in current through the other coil. In terms of the inductance of each coil and the coefﬁcient of cou- pling, the mutual inductance is determined by (henries, H) (21.9) The greater the coefﬁcient of coupling (greater ﬂux linkages), or the greater the inductance of either coil, the higher the mutual inductance between the coils. Relate this fact to the conﬁgurations of Fig. 21.2. The secondary voltage es can also be found in terms of the mutual inductance if we rewrite Eq. (21.3) as es \u0001 Ns\u0001\u0002\u0001 \u0002 and, since M \u0001 Ns(dfm /dip), it can also be written (volts, V) (21.10) Similarly, (volts, V) (21.11)ep \u0001 M \u0002 d d i t s \u0002 es \u0001 M \u0002 d d i t p \u0002 dip \u0002 dt dfm\u0002 dip M \u0001 k\u0003L\u0004p L\u0004s\u0004 M \u0001 Np \u0002 d d f is p \u0002 M \u0001 Ns \u0002 d d f ip m \u0002 es \u0001 kNs \u0002 d d f t p \u0002 dkfp\u0002 dt dfm\u0002 dt 938  TRANSFORMERS EXAMPLE 21.1 For the transformer in Fig. 21.3: a.

The iron core will serve to increase the coefﬁcient of coupling between the coils by increasing the mutual ﬂux fm. Recall from Chapter 11 that magnetic ﬂux lines will always take the path of least reluctance, which in this case is the iron core. dip \u0002 dt dip \u0002 dt dfp \u0002 dt dfp \u0002 dt ip – + ep – + es Lp = 200 mH Np = 50 turns p Ls = 800 mH Ns = 100 turns k = 0.6\u0001 FIG. 21.3 Example 21.1. ip + – + is es – + vL – ZL + – vg Np Ns ep Primary Secondary Iron core Φm Φm FIG. 21.4 Iron-core transformer. In the analyses to follow in this chapter, we will assume that all of the ﬂux linking coil 1 will link coil 2. In other words, the coefﬁcient of coupling is its maximum value, 1, and fm \u0001 fp \u0001 fs. In addition, we will ﬁrst analyze the transformer from an ideal viewpoint; that is, we will neglect losses such as the geometric or dc resistance of the coils, the leakage reactance due to the ﬂux linking either coil that forms no part of fm, and the hysteresis and eddy current losses. This is not to convey the impression, however, that we will be far from the actual THE IRON-CORE TRANSFORMER  939 operation of a transformer. Most transformers manufactured today can be considered almost ideal. The equations we will develop under ideal conditions will be, in general, a ﬁrst approximation to the actual response, which will never be off by more than a few percentage points. The losses will be considered in greater detail in Section 21.6. When the current ip through the primary circuit of the iron-core transformer is a maximum, the ﬂux fm linking both coils is also a max- imum. In fact, the magnitude of the ﬂux is directly proportional to the current through the primary windings. Therefore, the two are in phase, and for sinusoidal inputs, the magnitude of the ﬂux will vary as a sinu- soid also. That is, if ip \u0001 \u00032\u0004Ip sin qt then fm \u0001\u0005m sin qt The induced voltage across the primary due to a sinusoidal input can be determined by Faraday’s law: ep \u0001 Np \u0001 Np Substituting for fm gives us ep \u0001 Np (\u0005m sin qt) and differentiating, we obtain ep \u0001 qNp\u0005m cos qt or ep \u0001 qNp\u0005m sin(qt \u0006 90°) indicating that the induced voltage ep leads the current through the pri- mary coil by 90°. The effective value of ep is Ep \u0001\u0001 and (21.12) which is an equation for the rms value of the voltage across the primary coil in terms of the frequency of the input current or voltage, the num- ber of turns of the primary, and the maximum value of the magnetic ﬂux linking the primary. For the case under discussion, where the ﬂux linking the secondary equals that of the primary, if we repeat the procedure just described for the induced voltage across the secondary, we get (21.13) Dividing Eq. (21.12) by Eq. (21.13), as follows: \u0001 we obtain 4.44 fNp\u0005m\u0002\u0002 4.44 fNs\u0005m Ep \u0002 Es Es \u0001 4.44 fNs\u0005m Ep \u0001 4.44 fNp\u0005m 2pfNp\u0005m\u0002\u0002 \u00032\u0004 qNp\u0005m\u0002 \u00032\u0004 d \u0002 dt dfm\u0002 dt dfp \u0002 dt 940  TRANSFORMERS (21.14) revealing an important relationship for transformers: The ratio of the magnitudes of the induced voltages is the same as the ratio of the corresponding turns. If we consider that ep \u0001 Np and es \u0001 Ns and divide one by the other, that is, \u0001 then \u0001 The instantaneous values of e1 and e2 are therefore related by a con- stant determined by the turns ratio. Since their instantaneous magni- tudes are related by a constant, the induced voltages are in phase, and Equation (21.14) can be changed to include phasor notation; that is, (21.15) or, since Vg \u0001 E1 and VL \u0001 E2 for the ideal situation, (21.16) The ratio Np /Ns, usually represented by the lowercase letter a, is referred to as the transformation ratio: (21.17) If a < 1, the transformer is called a step-up transformer since the volt- age Es > Ep; that is, \u0001\u0001 a or Es \u0001 and, if a < 1, Es > Ep If a > 1, the transformer is called a step-down transformer since Es < Ep; that is, Ep \u0001 aEs and, if a > 1, then Ep > Es Ep \u0002 a Np \u0002 Ns Ep \u0002 Es a \u0001 \u0002 N N p s \u0002 \u0002 V V L g \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 N N p s \u0002 \u0002 E E p s \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 N N p s \u0002 Np \u0002 Ns ep \u0002 es Np(dfm/dt) \u0002\u0002 Ns(dfm/dt) ep \u0002 es dfm\u0002 dt dfm\u0002 dt \u0002 E E p s \u0002\u0001 \u0002 N N p s \u0002 THE IRON-CORE TRANSFORMER  941 EXAMPLE 21.2 For the iron-core transformer of Fig. 21.5: Np = 50 ip + Ep = 200 V – + Is – f = 60 Hz k = 1 Es = 2400 V Ns Φm Φm FIG. 21.5 Example 21.2. a.

This current and the turns Ns will develop an mmf Ns is that would not be present under no-load conditions since is \u0001 0 and Ns is \u0001 0. Under loaded or unloaded conditions, however, the net ampere-turns on the core produced by both the primary and the secondary must remain unchanged for the same ﬂux fm to be established in the core. The ﬂux fm must remain the same to have the same induced voltage across the primary and to balance the voltage impressed across the pri- mary. In order to counteract the mmf of the secondary, which is tending to change fm, an additional current must ﬂow in the primary. This cur- rent is called the load component of the primary current and is repre- sented by the notation i′p. For the balanced or equilibrium condition, Np i′p \u0001 Ns is The total current in the primary under loaded conditions is ip \u0001 i′p \u0006 ifm where ifm is the current in the primary necessary to establish the ﬂux fm. For most practical applications, i′p > ifm. For our analysis, we will assume ip \u0005 i′p, so Np ip \u0001 Ns is (50 t)(2400 V)\u0002\u0002 200 V Np Es\u0002 Ep Np \u0002 Ns Ep \u0002 Es 200 V\u0002\u0002 (4.44)(50 t)(60 Hz) Ep\u0002 4.44 Np f 942  TRANSFORMERS Since the instantaneous values of ip and is are related by the turns ratio, the phasor quantities Ip and Is are also related by the same ratio: Np Ip \u0001 Ns Is or (21.18) The primary and secondary currents of a transformer are therefore related by the inverse ratios of the turns. Keep in mind that Equation (21.18) holds true only if we neglect the effects of ifm. Otherwise, the magnitudes of Ip and Is are not related by the turns ratio, and Ip and Is are not in phase. For the step-up transformer, a < 1, and the current in the secondary, Is \u0001 aIp, is less in magnitude than that in the primary. For a step-down transformer, the reverse is true. 21.4 REFLECTED IMPEDANCE AND POWER In the previous section we found that \u0001\u0001 a and \u0001\u0001 Dividing the ﬁrst by the second, we have \u0001 or \u0001 a 2 and \u0001 a2 However, since Zp \u0001 and ZL \u0001 then (21.19) which in words states that the impedance of the primary circuit of an ideal transformer is the transformation ratio squared times the imped- ance of the load. If a transformer is used, therefore, an impedance can be made to appear larger or smaller at the primary by placing it in the secondary of a step-down (a > 1) or step-up (a < 1) transformer, respec- tively. Note that if the load is capacitive or inductive, the reﬂected impedance will also be capacitive or inductive.

Recall that maxi- mum power is transferred to a load when its impedance is a match with the internal resistance of the supply. Even if a perfect match is unat- tainable, the closer the load matches the internal resistance, the greater the power to the load and the more efﬁcient the system. Unfortunately, unless it is planned as part of the design, most loads are not a close match with the internal impedance of the supply. However, transform- ers have a unique relationship between their primary and secondary impedances that can be put to good use in the impedance matching process. Example 21.5 will demonstrate the signiﬁcant difference in the power delivered to the load with and without an impedance matching transformer. EXAMPLE 21.5 a. The source impedance for the supply of Fig. 21.8(a) is 512 \u0007, which is a poor match with the 8-\u0007 input impedance of the speaker. One can expect only that the power delivered to the speaker will be sig- niﬁcantly less than the maximum possible level. Determine the power to the speaker under the conditions of Fig. 21.8(a). b. In Fig. 21.8(b), an audio impedance matching transformer was intro- duced between the speaker and the source, and it was designed to ensure maximum power to the 8-\u0007 speaker.

This is not the case where the desired result is to match the load to the input impedance; rather, it was to ensure 70.7 V at each pri- mary, no matter how many speakers were connected, and to limit the current drawn from the supply. The transformer is frequently used to isolate one portion of an elec- trical system from another. Isolation implies the absence of any direct physical connection. As a ﬁrst example of its use as an isolation device, consider the measurement of line voltages on the order of 40,000 V (Fig. 21.11). 500 \u0007\u0002 4 500 \u0007\u0002 3 500 \u0007\u0002 2 Lines 40,000 V + – Np Ns = 400 = a Voltmeter 100 V + – V FIG. 21.11 Isolating a high-voltage line from the point of measurement. To apply a voltmeter across 40,000 V would obviously be a danger- ous task due to the possibility of physical contact with the lines when making the necessary connections. By including a transformer in the transmission system as original equipment, one can bring the potential down to a safe level for measurement purposes and can determine the line voltage using the turns ratio. Therefore, the transformer will serve both to isolate and to step down the voltage. As a second example, consider the application of the voltage vx to the vertical input of the oscilloscope (a measuring instrument) in Fig. 21.12. If the connections are made as shown, and if the generator and oscilloscope have a common ground, the impedance Z2 has been effec- tively shorted out of the circuit by the ground connection of the oscil- loscope. The input voltage to the oscilloscope will therefore be mean- vx + – Vertical channel vg + – + – Oscilloscope Z1 Z2 FIG. 21.12 Demonstrating the shorting effect introduced by the grounded side of the vertical channel of an oscilloscope. 948  TRANSFORMERS ingless as far as the voltage vx is concerned. In addition, if Z2 is the current-limiting impedance in the circuit, the current in the circuit may rise to a level that will cause severe damage to the circuit. If a trans- former is used as shown in Fig. 21.13, this problem will be eliminated, and the input voltage to the oscilloscope will be vx. The linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is a sensor that can reveal displacement using transformer effects. In its simplest form, the LVDT has a central winding and two secondary windings, as shown in Fig. 21.14(a). A ferromagnetic core inside the windings is free to move as dictated by some external force. A constant, low-level ac voltage is applied to the primary, and the output voltage is the dif- ference between the voltages induced in the secondaries. If the core is in the position shown in Fig. 21.14(b), a relatively large voltage will be induced across the secondary winding labeled coil 1, and a rela- tively small voltage will be induced across the secondary winding labeled coil 2 (essentially an air-core transformer for this position). The result is a relatively large secondary output voltage. If the core is in the position shown in Fig. 21.14(c), the ﬂux linking each coil is the same, and the output voltage (being the difference) will be quite small. In total, therefore, the position of the core can be related to the sec- ondary voltage, and a position-versus-voltage graph can be developed as shown in Fig. 21.14(d). Due to the nonlinearity of the B-H curve, the curve becomes somewhat nonlinear if the core is moved too far out of the unit.

As indicated, part of this equivalent circuit includes an ideal transformer. The remaining elements of Fig. 21.15 are those elements that contribute to the nonideal characteristics of the device. The resistances Rp and Rs are simply the dc or geometric resis- tance of the primary and secondary windings, respectively. For the pri- EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT (IRON-CORE TRANSFORMER)  949 mary and secondary coils of a transformer, there is a small amount of ﬂux that links each coil but does not pass through the core, as shown in Fig. 21.16 for the primary winding. This leakage ﬂux, representing a deﬁnite loss in the system, is represented by an inductance Lp in the pri- mary circuit and an inductance Ls in the secondary. The resistance Rc represents the hysteresis and eddy current losses (core losses) within the core due to an ac ﬂux through the core. The induc- tance Lm (magnetizing inductance) is the inductance associated with the magnetization of the core, that is, the establishing of the ﬂux \u0005m in the core. The capacitances Cp and Cs are the lumped capacitances of the pri- mary and secondary circuits, respectively, and Cw represents the equiva- lent lumped capacitances between the windings of the transformer. Since i′p is normally considerably larger than ifm (the magnetizing current), we will ignore ifm for the moment (set it equal to zero), result- ing in the absence of Rc and Lm in the reduced equivalent circuit of Fig. 21.17. The capacitances Cp, Cw, and Cs do not appear in the equivalent circuit of Fig. 21.17 since their reactance at typical operating frequencies will not appreciably affect the transfer characteristics of the transformer. – + Ep Rp Lp RCCp Np Ns RLCs EsLm RsLs – + ip ifm i'p Cw Ideal transformer FIG. 21.15 Equivalent circuit for the practical iron-core transformer.

If we now reﬂect the secondary circuit through the ideal transformer using Eq. (21.19), as shown in Fig. 21.18(a), we will have the load and generator voltage in the same continuous circuit. The total resistance and inductive reactance of the primary circuit are determined by (21.22)Requivalent \u0001 Re \u0001 Rp \u0006 a 2Rs 950  TRANSFORMERS and (21.23) which result in the useful equivalent circuit of Fig. 21.18(b). The load voltage can be obtained directly from the circuit of Fig. 21.18(b) through the voltage divider rule: aVL \u0001 and VL \u0001 (21.24) The network of Fig. 21.18(b) will also allow us to calculate the generator voltage necessary to establish a particular load voltage. The voltages across the elements of Fig. 21.18(b) have the phasor rela- tionship indicated in Fig. 21.19(a). Note that the current is the refer- ence phasor for drawing the phasor diagram. That is, the voltages across the resistive elements are in phase with the current phasor, while the voltage across the equivalent inductance leads the current by 90°. The primary voltage, by Kirchhoff’s voltage law, is then the pha- sor sum of these voltages, as indicated in Fig. 21.19(a). For an induc- tive load, the phasor diagram appears in Fig. 21.19(b). Note that aVL leads I by the power-factor angle of the load. The remainder of the diagram is then similar to that for a resistive load. (The phasor dia- gram for a capacitive load will be left to the reader as an exercise.) The effect of Re and Xe on the magnitude of Vg for a particular VL is obvious from Eq. (21.24) or Fig. 21.19. For increased values of Re or Xe, an increase in Vg is required for the same load voltage. For Re and Xe \u0001 0, VL and Vg are simply related by the turns ratio.

Therefore, it is necessary to increase the generator voltage by 52.04 V (due to Re and Xe) to obtain the same load voltage. 21.7 FREQUENCY CONSIDERATIONS For certain frequency ranges, the effect of some parameters in the equivalent circuit of the iron-core transformer of Fig. 21.15 should not be ignored. Since it is convenient to consider a low-, mid-, and high- frequency region, the equivalent circuits for each will now be intro- duced and brieﬂy examined. For the low-frequency region, the series reactance (2pfL) of the pri- mary and secondary leakage reactances can be ignored since they are 952  TRANSFORMERS small in magnitude. The magnetizing inductance must be included, however, since it appears in parallel with the secondary reﬂected cir- cuit, and small impedances in a parallel network can have a dramatic impact on the terminal characteristics. The resulting equivalent network for the low-frequency region is provided in Fig. 21.22(a). As the fre- quency decreases, the reactance of the magnetizing inductance will reduce in magnitude, causing a reduction in the voltage across the sec- ondary circuit. For f \u0001 0 Hz, Lm is ideally a short circuit, and VL \u0001 0. As the frequency increases, the reactance of Lm will eventually be suf- ﬁciently large compared with the reﬂected secondary impedance to be neglected. The mid-frequency reﬂected equivalent circuit will then appear as shown in Fig. 21.22(b). Note the absence of reactive ele- ments, resulting in an in-phase relationship between load and generator voltages. For higher frequencies, the capacitive elements and primary and sec- ondary leakage reactances must be considered, as shown in Fig. 21.23. For discussion purposes, the effects of Cw and Cs appear as a lumped capacitor C in the reﬂected network of Fig. 21.23; Cp does not appear since the effect of C will predominate. As the frequency of interest increases, the capacitive reactance (XC \u0001 1/2pfC) will decrease to the point that it will have a shorting effect across the secondary circuit of the transformer, causing VL to decrease in magnitude.

SERIES CONNECTION OF MUTUALLY COUPLED COILS  953 21.8 SERIES CONNECTION OF MUTUALLY COUPLED COILS In Chapter 12, we found that the total inductance of series isolated coils was determined simply by the sum of the inductances. For two coils that are connected in series but also share the same ﬂux linkages, such as those in Fig. 21.25(a), a mutual term is introduced that will alter the total inductance of the series combination. The physical picture of how the coils are connected is indicated in Fig. 21.25(b). An iron core is included, although the equations to be developed are for any two mutually coupled coils with any value of coefﬁcient of coupling k. When referring to the voltage induced across the inductance L1 (or L2) due to the change in ﬂux linkages of the inductance L2 (or L1, respectively), the mutual inductance is represented by M12. This type of subscript notation is particularly important when there are two or more mutual terms. Due to the presence of the mutual term, the induced voltage e1 is composed of that due to the self-inductance L1 and that due to the mutual inductance M12. That is, e1 \u0001 L1 \u0006 M12 However, since i1 \u0001 i2 \u0001 i, e1 \u0001 L1 \u0006 M12 or (volts, V) (21.25) and, similarly, (volts, V) (21.26) For the series connection, the total induced voltage across the series coils, represented by eT, is eT \u0001 e1 \u0006 e2 \u0001 (L1 \u0006 M12) \u0006 (L2 \u0006 M12) or eT \u0001 (L1 \u0006 L2 \u0006 M12 \u0006 M12) and the total effective inductance is (henries, H) (21.27) The subscript (\u0006) was included to indicate that the mutual terms have a positive sign and are added to the self-inductance values to determine the total inductance. If the coils were wound such as shown in Fig. 21.26, where f1 and f2 are in opposition, the induced voltages due to the mutual terms would oppose that due to the self-inductance, and the total inductance would be determined by (henries, H) (21.28)LT(\u0004) \u0001 L1 \u0006 L2 \u0004 2M12 LT(\u0006) \u0001 L1 \u0006 L2 \u0006 2M12 di \u0002 dt di \u0002 dt di \u0002 dt e2 \u0001 (L2 \u0006 M12)\u0002 d di t \u0002 e1 \u0001 (L1 \u0006 M12)\u0002 d di t \u0002 di \u0002 dt di \u0002 dt di2 \u0002 dt di1 \u0002 dt +–e1 +–e2 Iron core M = M12 (+) L1 L2 (a) L1 L2 M12 (+) +–e1 +–e2 i2 (b) i1 1φ 2φ FIG. 21.25 Mutually coupled coils connected in series.

(21.27) and (21.28), the mutual inductance can be determined by (21.29) Equation (21.29) is very effective in determining the mutual induc- tance between two coils. It states that the mutual inductance is equal to one-quarter the difference between the total inductance with a positive and negative mutual effect. From the preceding, it should be clear that the mutual inductance will directly affect the magnitude of the voltage induced across a coil since it will determine the net inductance of the coil. Additional exam- ination reveals that the sign of the mutual term for each coil of a cou- pled pair is the same. For LT(\u0006) they were both positive, and for LT(\u0004) they were both negative. On a network schematic where it is inconve- nient to indicate the windings and the ﬂux path, a system of dots is employed that will determine whether the mutual terms are to be posi- tive or negative. The dot convention is shown in Fig. 21.27 for the series coils of Figs. 21.25 and 21.26. If the current through each of the mutually coupled coils is going away from (or toward) the dot as it passes through the coil, the mutual term will be positive, as shown for the case in Fig. 21.27(a). If the arrow indicating current direction through the coil is leaving the dot for one coil and entering the dot for the other, the mutual term is negative. A few possibilities for mutually coupled transformer coils are indi- cated in Fig. 21.28(a). The sign of M is indicated for each. When deter- mining the sign, be sure to examine the current direction within the coil itself. In Fig. 21.28(b), one direction was indicated outside for one coil and through for the other. It initially might appear that the sign should be positive since both currents enter the dot, but the current through coil 1 is leaving the dot; hence a negative sign is in order.

The dot convention also reveals the polarity of the induced voltage across the mutually coupled coil. If the reference direction for the cur- rent in a coil leaves the dot, the polarity at the dot for the induced volt- age of the mutually coupled coil is positive. In the ﬁrst two ﬁgures of Fig. 21.28(a), the polarity at the dots of the induced voltages is positive. In the third ﬁgure of Fig. 21.28(a), the polarity at the dot of the right- hand coil is negative, while the polarity at the dot of the left-hand coil is positive, since the current enters the dot (within the coil) of the right- hand coil.

The 5 kVA is the apparent power (S \u0001 VI ) rating of the transformer. If the secondary voltage is 100 V, then the maximum load current is IL \u0001\u0001 \u0001 50 A and if the secondary voltage is 2000 V, then the maximum load cur- rent is IL \u0001\u0001 \u0001 2.5 A The transformer is rated in terms of the apparent power rather than the average, or real, power for the reason demonstrated by the circuit of Fig. 21.34. Since the current through the load is greater than that determined by the apparent power rating, the transformer may be per- manently damaged. Note, however, that since the load is purely capac- itive, the average power to the load is zero. The wattage rating would therefore be meaningless regarding the ability of this load to damage the transformer. The transformation ratio of the transformer under discussion can be either of two values. If the secondary voltage is 2000 V, the transfor- mation ratio is a \u0001 Np/Ns \u0001 Vg /VL \u0001 100 V/2000 V \u0001 1/20, and the transformer is a step-up transformer. If the secondary voltage is 100 V, the transformation ratio is a \u0001 Np/Ns \u0001 Vg /VL \u0001 2000 V/100 V \u0001 20, and the transformer is a step-down transformer. The rated primary current can be determined simply by applying Eq. (21.18): Ip \u0001 which is equal to [2.5 A/(1/20)] \u0001 50 A if the secondary voltage is 2000 V, and (50 A/20) \u0001 2.5 A if the secondary voltage is 100 V. To explain the necessity for including the frequency in the nameplate data, consider Eq. (21.12): Ep \u0001 4.44fpNp\u0005m and the B-H curve for the iron core of the transformer (Fig. 21.35). The point of operation on the B-H curve for most transformers is at the knee of the curve.

The resulting DI could cause a very high current in the primary, resulting in possible damage to the transformer. 21.11 TYPES OF TRANSFORMERS Transformers are available in many different shapes and sizes. Some of the more common types include the power transformer, audio trans- former, IF (intermediate-frequency) transformer, and RF (radio- frequency) transformer. Each is designed to fulﬁll a particular require- ment in a speciﬁc area of application. The symbols for some of the basic types of transformers are shown in Fig. 21.36.

Air-core Iron-core Variable-core FIG. 21.36 Transformer symbols. The method of construction varies from one transformer to another. Two of the many different ways in which the primary and secondary coils can be wound around an iron core are shown in Fig. 21.37. In either case, the core is made of laminated sheets of ferromagnetic mate- rial separated by an insulator to reduce the eddy current losses. The sheets themselves will also contain a small percentage of silicon to increase the electrical resistivity of the material and further reduce the eddy current losses. A variation of the core-type transformer appears in Fig. 21.38.

There are actually two transformers on the same core, with the primary and secondary of each wound side by side. The schematic representation appears in the same ﬁgure. Each set of termi- nals on the left can accept 115 V at 50 or 60 Hz, whereas each side of the output will provide 230 V at the same frequency. Note the dot con- vention, as described earlier in the chapter. The autotransformer [Fig. 21.39(b)] is a type of power transformer that, instead of employing the two-circuit principle (complete isolation between coils), has one winding common to both the input and the out- put circuits. The induced voltages are related to the turns ratio in the same manner as that described for the two-circuit transformer. If the proper connection is used, a two-circuit power transformer can be FIG. 21.38 Split bobbin, low-proﬁle power transformer. (Courtesy of Microtran Company, Inc.)

Note also that the cur- rent and voltage of each coil are the same as those for the two-circuit conﬁguration. The disadvantage of the autotransformer is obvious: loss of the isolation between the primary and secondary circuits. A pulse transformer designed for printed-circuit applications where high-amplitude, long-duration pulses must be transferred without satu- ration appears in Fig. 21.40. Turns ratios are available from 1: 1 to 5: 1 at maximum line voltages of 240 V rms at 60 Hz. The upper unit is for printed-circuit applications with isolated dual primaries, whereas the lower unit is the bobbin variety with a single primary winding. Two miniature ( in. by in.) transformers with plug-in or insulated leads appear in Fig. 21.41, along with their schematic representations. Power ratings of 100 mW or 125 mW are available with a variety of turns ratios, such as 1: 1, 5: 1, 9.68: 1, and 25: 1. 1 \u0002 4 1 \u0002 4 1 \u0002 20 FIG. 21.40 Pulse transformers.

A ﬁrm understanding of the dot convention discussed earlier should make the writing of the equations quite direct and free of errors. Before writing the equations for any particular loop, ﬁrst determine whether the mutual term is pos- itive or negative, keeping in mind that it will have the same sign as that for the other magnetically coupled coil. For the two-loop network of Fig. 21.45, for example, the mutual term has a positive sign since the current through each coil leaves the dot.

Transformers were used to increase or decrease the voltage or current level, to act as an impedance matching device, or in some cases to play a dual role of transformer action and reactive element. They are so common in such a wide variety of systems that one should make an effort to be very famil- iar with their general characteristics. For most applications their design today is such that they can be considered 100% efﬁcient. That is, the power applied is the power delivered to the load. In general, however, they are frequently the largest element of a design and because of the nonlinearity of the B-H curve can cause some distortion of the trans- formed waveform. By now it should be clear that they are useful only in situations where the applied voltage is changing with time. The application of a dc voltage to the primary will result in 0 V at the sec- ondary, but the application of a voltage that changes with time, no mat- ter what its general appearance, will result in a voltage on the sec- 964  TRANSFORMERS ondary. Always keep in mind that even though it can provide isolation between the primary and secondary circuits, a transformer can trans- form the load impedance to the primary circuit at a level that can sig- niﬁcantly impact on the behavior of the network. Even the smallest impedance in the secondary can be made to appear very large in the pri- mary when a step-down transformer is used. Transformers, like every other component you may use, have power ratings. The larger the power rating, the larger the resulting transformer, primarily because of the larger conductors in the windings to handle the current. The size of a transformer is also a function of the frequency involved. The lower the frequency, the larger the required transformer, as easily recognized by the size of large power transformers (also affected by the current levels as mentioned above). For the same power level the higher the frequency of transformation, the smaller the trans- former can be. Because of eddy current and hysteresis losses in a trans- former, the design of the core is quite important. A solid core would introduce high levels of such losses, whereas a core constructed of sheets of high-permeability steel with the proper insulation between the sheets would reduce the losses signiﬁcantly. Although very fundamental in their basic structure, transformers are recognized as one of the major building blocks of electrical and elec- tronic systems. There isn’t a publication on new components published that does not include a new design for the variety of applications devel- oping every day. Low-Voltage Compensation At times during the year, peak demands from the power company can result in a reduced voltage down the line. In midsummer, for example, the line voltage may drop from 120 V to 100 V because of the heavy load often due primarily to air conditioners. However, air conditioners do not run as well under low-voltage conditions, so the following option using an autotransformer may be the solution. In Fig. 21.47(a), an air conditioner drawing 10 A at 120 V is con- nected through an autotransformer to the available supply that has dropped to 100 V. Assuming 100% efﬁciency, the current drawn from the line would have to be 12 A to ensure that Pi \u0001 Po \u0001 1200 W. Using the analysis introduced in Section 21.11, we will ﬁnd that the current in the primary winding is 2 A with 10 A in the secondary. The 12 A will (b) Step-up isolation transformer Source 100 V 12 A 10 A + – 120-V air conditioner – + (a) 100 V + – Source 12 A 2 A 10 A Autotransformer + – 120-V air conditioner FIG. 21.47 Maintaining a 120-V supply for an air conditioner: (a) using an autotransformer; (b) using a traditional step-up transformer. APPLICATIONS  965 exist only in the line connecting the source to the primary. If the volt- age level were increased using the traditional step-up transformer shown in Fig. 21.47(b), the same currents would result at the source and load. However, note that the current through the primary is now 12 A which is 6 times that in the autotransformer. The result is that the wind- ing in the autotransformer can be much thinner due to the signiﬁcantly lower current level. Let us now examine the turns ratio required and the number of turns involved for each setup (associating one turn with each volt of the pri- mary and secondary). For the autotransformer: \u0002 N N p s \u0002\u0001 \u0002 V V p s \u0002\u0001 \u0002 1 1 0 0 0 V V \u0002 ⇒ \u0002 1 1 0 0 0t t \u0002 For the traditional transformer: \u0002 N N p s \u0002\u0001 \u0002 V V p s \u0002\u0001 \u0002 1 12 00 0 V V \u0002 ⇒ \u0002 1 12 00 0 t t \u0002 In total, therefore, the autotransformer has only 10 turns in the sec- ondary, whereas the traditional has 120. For the autotransformer we need only 10 turns of heavy wire to handle the current of 10 A, not the full 120 required for the traditional transformer. In addition, the total number of turns for the autotransformer is 110 compared to 220 for the traditional transformer. The net result of all the above is that even though the protection offered by the isolation feature is lost, the autotransformer can be much smaller in size and weight and, therefore, less costly. Ballast Transformer Until just recently, all ﬂuorescent lights such as appearing in Fig. 21.48(a) had a ballast transformer as shown in Fig. 21.48(b). In many cases its weight alone is almost equal to that of the ﬁxture itself. In recent years a solid-state equivalent transformer has been developed that in time may replace most of the ballast transformers. However, for now and the near future, because of the additional cost associated with the solid-state variety, the ballast transformer will appear in most ﬂuo- rescent bulbs. The basic connections for a single-bulb ﬂuorescent light are pro- vided in Fig. 21.49(a). Note that the transformer is connected as an autotransformer with the full applied 120 V across the primary. When the switch is closed, the applied voltage and the voltage across the sec- ondary will add and establish a current through the ﬁlaments of the ﬂu- orescent bulb. The starter is initially a short circuit to establish the con- tinuous path through the two ﬁlaments. In older ﬂuorescent bulbs the starter was a cylinder with two contacts, as shown in Fig. 21.49(b), which had to be replaced on occasion. It sat right under the ﬂuorescent bulb near one of the bulb connections. Now, as shown by the sketch of the inside of a ballast transformer in Fig. 21.49(c), the starter is now commonly built into the ballast and can no longer be replaced. The volt- age established by the autotransformer action is sufﬁcient to heat the ﬁl- aments but not light the ﬂuorescent bulb. The ﬂuorescent lamp is a long tube with a coating of ﬂuorescent paint on the inside. It is ﬁlled with an inert gas and a small amount of liquid mercury. The distance between the electrodes at the ends of the lamp is too much for the applied auto- 966  TRANSFORMERS transformer voltage to establish conduction. To overcome this problem, the ﬁlaments are ﬁrst heated as described above to convert the mercury (a good conductor) from a liquid to a gas. Conduction can then be established by the application of a large potential across the electrodes. This potential is established when the starter (a thermal switch that opens when it reaches a particular temperature) opens and causes the inductor current to drop from its established level to zero amperes. This quick drop in current will establish a very high spike in voltage across the coils of the autotransformer as determined by vL \u0001 L(diL /dt). This signiﬁcant spike in voltage will also appear across the bulb and will establish current between the electrodes. Light will then be given off as the electrons hit the ﬂuorescent surface on the inside of the tube. It is the persistence of the coating that helps hide the oscillation in conduc- tion level due to the low-frequency (60-Hz) power that could result in a ﬂickering light. The starter will remain open until the next time the bulb is turned on. The ﬂow of charge between electrodes will then be main- tained solely by the voltage across the autotransformer. This current is relatively low in magnitude because of the reactance of the secondary winding in the resulting series circuit. In other words, the autotrans- former has shifted to one that is now providing a reactance to the sec- ondary circuit to limit the current through the bulb. Without this limit- ing factor the current through the bulb would be too high, and the bulb would quickly burn out. This action of the coils of the transformer gen- erating the required voltage and then acting as a coil to limit the current has resulted in the general terminology of swinging choke. The fact that the light is not generated by an IR drop across a ﬁla- ment of a bulb is the reason ﬂuorescent lights are so energy efﬁcient.

In a ﬂuorescent bulb more than 70% goes to light emission and 30% to heat losses. As a rule of thumb, one can assume that the lighting from a 40-W ﬂuorescent lamp [such as the unit of Fig. 21.48(a) with its two 20-W bulbs] is equivalent to that of a 100-W incandescent bulb. One other interesting difference between incandescent and ﬂuores- cent bulbs is the method of determining whether they are good or bad. For the incandescent light it is immediately obvious when it fails to give light at all. For the ﬂuorescent bulb, however, assuming that the ballast is in good working order, the bulb will begin to dim as its life wears on. The electrodes will get coated and be less efﬁcient, and the coating on the inner surface will begin to deteriorate. Rapid-start ﬂuorescent lamps are different in operation only in that the voltage generated by the transformer is sufﬁciently large to atomize the gas upon application and initiate conduction, thereby removing the need for a starter and eliminating the warm-up time of the ﬁlaments. In time the solid-state ballast will probably be the unit of choice because of its quick response, higher efﬁciency, and lighter weight, but the transition will take some time. The basic operation will remain the same, however. Because of the ﬂuorine gas (hence the name ﬂuorescent bulb) and the mercury in ﬂuorescent lamps, they must be discarded with care. Ask your local disposal facility where to take the bulbs. Breaking them for FIG. 21.49 (a) Schematic of single-bulb ﬂuorescent lamp; (b) starter; (c) internal view of ballast transformer.

If you happen to break a bulb and get cut in the process, be sure to go right to a medical facility since you could sustain ﬂuorine or mercury poisoning. 21.15 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice Transformer (Controlled Sources) The simple transformer con- ﬁguration of Fig. 21.50 will now be investigated using controlled sources to mimic the behavior of the transformer as deﬁned by its basic voltage and current relationships. + – Zi Ep Es RL 100 \u0001 R1 10 \u0001 Vg = 20 V ∠ 0° 1 : 4 + – + – FIG. 21.50 Applying PSpice to a step-up transformer.

The fact that the magnitude of one voltage is controlled by another requires that we use the Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source(VCVS) source in the ANALOG library. It appears as E in the Parts List and has the format appearing in Fig. 21.51. The sensing voltage is E1, and the controlled voltage appears across the two terminals of the circular symbol for a voltage source. Double-clicking on the source symbol will permit set- ting the GAIN to 4 for this example. Note in Fig. 21.51 that the sens- ing voltage is the primary voltage of the circuit of Fig. 21.50, and the output voltage is connected directly to the load resistor RL. There is no real problem making the necessary connections because of the format of the E source. The next step is to set up the current relationship for the transformer. Since the magnitude of one current will be controlled by the magnitude of another current in the same conﬁguration, a Current-Controlled 1 \u0002 a (6.25 \u0005)(20 V)\u0002\u0002 6.25 \u0005\u0004 10 \u0005 1 \u0002 4 COMPUTER ANALYSIS  969 Current Source(CCCS) must be employed. It also appears in the ANALOG library under the Part List as F and has the format appear- ing in Fig. 21.51. Note that both currents have a direction associated with them. For the ideal transformer, Ip \u0001 Ns/Np(Is) which is Ip \u0001 4Is for the network of Fig. 21.50. The gain for the part can be set using the same procedure deﬁned for the E source. Since the secondary current will be the controlling current, its level must be fed into the F source in the same direction as indicated in the controlled source. When making this connection, be sure to click the wire in location before crossing the wire of the primary circuit and then clicking it again after crossing the wire. If you do this properly, a connection point indicated by a small red dot will not appear. The controlled current IR1 can be connected as shown because the connection E1 is only sensing a voltage level, essen- tially has inﬁnite impedance, and can be looked upon as an open circuit. In other words, the current through R1 will be the same as through the controlled source of F. A simulation was set up with AC Sweep and 1 kHz for the Start and End Frequencies. One data point per decade was selected, and the sim- ulation was initiated. After the SCHEMATIC1 screen appeared, the window was exited, and PSpice-View Output File was selected to result in the AC ANALYSIS solution of Fig. 21.52. Note that the volt- age is 30.77 V, which is an exact match with the theoretical solution. Transformer (Library) The same network can be analyzed by choosing one of the transformers from the EVAL library as shown in Fig. 21.53. The transformer labeled K3019PL_3C8 was chosen, and the proper attributes were placed in the Property Editor dialog box.

When the simulation was run, the results under PSpice-View Output File appeared as shown in Fig. 21.54—almost an exact match with the theoretical solution of 30.77 V.

If the number of coils on the rotor is increased in a speciﬁed manner, the result is a polyphase ac generator, which develops more than one ac phase voltage per rotation of the rotor. In this chapter, the three-phase system will be discussed in detail since it is the most fre- quently used for power transmission. In general, three-phase systems are preferred over single-phase sys- tems for the transmission of power for many reasons, including the fol- lowing: 1. Thinner conductors can be used to transmit the same kVA at the same voltage, which reduces the amount of copper required (typ- ically about 25% less) and in turn reduces construction and main- tenance costs. 2. The lighter lines are easier to install, and the supporting struc- tures can be less massive and farther apart. 3. Three-phase equipment and motors have preferred running and starting characteristics compared to single-phase systems because of a more even ﬂow of power to the transducer than can be deliv- ered with a single-phase supply. 4. In general, most larger motors are three phase because they are essentially self-starting and do not require a special design or additional starting circuitry. The frequency generated is determined by the number of poles on the rotor (the rotating part of the generator) and the speed with which the shaft is turned. Throughout the United States the line frequency is 60 Hz, whereas in Europe the chosen standard is 50 Hz. Both frequen- cies were chosen primarily because they can be generated by a rela- tively efﬁcient and stable mechanical design that is sensitive to the size of the generating systems and the demand that must be met during peak Polyphase Systems 978  POLYPHASE SYSTEMS periods. On aircraft and ships the demand levels permit the use of a 400-Hz line frequency. The three-phase system is used by almost all commercial electric generators. This does not mean that single-phase and two-phase gener- ating systems are obsolete. Most small emergency generators, such as the gasoline type, are one-phase generating systems. The two-phase system is commonly used in servomechanisms, which are self-correct- ing control systems capable of detecting and adjusting their own opera- tion. Servomechanisms are used in ships and aircraft to keep them on course automatically, or, in simpler devices such as a thermostatic cir- cuit, to regulate heat output. In many cases, however, where single- phase and two-phase inputs are required, they are supplied by one and two phases of a three-phase generating system rather than generated independently. The number of phase voltages that can be produced by a polyphase generator is not limited to three. Any number of phases can be obtained by spacing the windings for each phase at the proper angular position around the stator. Some electrical systems operate more efﬁciently if more than three phases are used. One such system involves the process of rectiﬁcation, which is used to convert an alternating output to one having an average, or dc, value. The greater the number of phases, the smoother the dc output of the system. 22.2 THE THREE-PHASE GENERATOR The three-phase generator of Fig. 22.1(a) has three induction coils placed 120° apart on the stator, as shown symbolically by Fig. 22.1(b). Since the three coils have an equal number of turns, and each coil rotates with the same angular velocity, the voltage induced across each coil will have the same peak value, shape, and frequency. As the shaft of the generator is turned by some external means, the induced voltages eAN, eBN, and eCN will be generated simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 22.2. Note the 120° phase shift between waveforms and the similarities in appearance of the three sinusoidal functions. 120° A BC + – eAN N – N N 120° 120° eBN eCN + + – (b) A (a) B C N FIG. 22.1 (a) Three-phase generator; (b) induced voltages of a three-phase generator.

THE THREE-PHASE GENERATOR  979 This is shown at qt \u0001 0 in Fig. 22.2, where it is also evident that when one induced voltage is zero, the other two are 86.6% of their positive or negative maximums. In addition, when any two are equal in magnitude and sign (at 0.5Em), the remaining induced voltage has the opposite polarity and a peak value. The sinusoidal expression for each of the induced voltages of Fig. 22.2 is (22.1) The phasor diagram of the induced voltages is shown in Fig. 22.3, where the effective value of each is determined by EAN \u0001 0.707Em(AN) EBN \u0001 0.707Em(BN) ECN \u0001 0.707Em(CN) and EAN \u0001 EAN \u00010° EBN \u0001 EBN \u0001\u0002120° ECN \u0001 ECN \u0001\u0003120° By rearranging the phasors as shown in Fig. 22.4 and applying a law of vectors which states that the vector sum of any number of vectors drawn such that the “head” of one is connected to the “tail” of the next, and that the head of the last vector is connected to the tail of the ﬁrst is zero, we can conclude that the phasor sum of the phase voltages in a three-phase system is zero.

As indicated in Fig. 22.5, the Y is inverted for ease of nota- tion and for clarity. The point at which all the terminals are connected is called the neutral point. If a conductor is not attached from this point to the load, the system is called a Y-connected, three-phase, three-wire generator. If the neutral is connected, the system is a Y-connected, three-phase, four-wire generator. The function of the neutral will be discussed in detail when we consider the load circuit. The three conductors connected from A, B, and C to the load are called lines. For the Y-connected system, it should be obvious from Fig. 22.5 that the line current equals the phase current for each phase; that is, (22.3) where f is used to denote a phase quantity and g is a generator param- eter. The voltage from one line to another is called a line voltage. On the phasor diagram (Fig. 22.6) it is the phasor drawn from the end of one phase to another in the counterclockwise direction. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the indicated loop of Fig. 22.6, we obtain EAB \u0002 EAN \u0003 EBN \u0001 0 or EAB \u0001 EAN \u0002 EBN \u0001 EAN \u0003 ENB The phasor diagram is redrawn to ﬁnd EAB as shown in Fig. 22.7. Since each phase voltage, when reversed (ENB), will bisect the other two, a \u0001 60°. The angle b is 30° since a line drawn from opposite ends of a rhombus will divide in half both the angle of origin and the opposite angle. Lines drawn between opposite corners of a rhombus will also bisect each other at right angles. IL \u0001 Ifg FIG. 22.5 Y-connected generator.

If the phasors representing the line voltages in Fig. 22.8(a) are rearranged slightly, they will form a closed loop [Fig. 22.8(b)].

For example, in Fig. 22.9 the phase sequence is ABC. However, since the ﬁxed point can be chosen anywhere on the phasor diagram, the sequence can also be written as BCA or CAB. The phase sequence is quite important in the three-phase distribution of power. In a three- phase motor, for example, if two phase voltages are interchanged, the sequence will change, and the direction of rotation of the motor will be reversed. Other effects will be described when we consider the loaded three-phase system. The phase sequence can also be described in terms of the line volt- ages. Drawing the line voltages on a phasor diagram in Fig. 22.10, we are able to determine the phase sequence by again rotating the phasors in the counterclockwise direction. In this case, however, the sequence can be determined by noting the order of the passing ﬁrst or second subscripts. In the system of Fig. 22.10, for example, the phase sequence of the ﬁrst subscripts passing point P is ABC, and the phase sequence of the second subscripts is BCA. But we know that BCA is equivalent to ABC, so the sequence is the same for each. Note that the phase sequence is the same as that of the phase voltages described in Fig. 22.9. If the sequence is given, the phasor diagram can be drawn by sim- ply picking a reference voltage, placing it on the reference axis, and then drawing the other voltages at the proper angular position. For a sequence of ACB, for example, we might choose EAB to be the refer- ence [Fig. 22.11(a)] if we wanted the phasor diagram of the line volt- ages, or ENA for the phase voltages [Fig. 22.11(b)]. For the sequence indicated, the phasor diagrams would be as in Fig. 22.11.

(This will be demonstrated in Example 22.1.) Note that in order to have a balanced load, the phase angle must also be the same for each impedance—a condition that was unnecessary in dc cir- cuits when we considered balanced systems. In practice, if a factory, for example, had only balanced, three-phase loads, the absence of the neutral would have no effect since, ideally, the system would always be balanced. The cost would therefore be less since the number of required conductors would be reduced. However, lighting and most other electrical equipment will use only one of the phase volt- ages, and even if the loading is designed to be balanced (as it should be), there will never be perfect continuous balancing since lights and other electrical equipment will be turned on and off, upsetting the balanced condition. The neutral is therefore necessary to carry the resulting cur- rent away from the load and back to the Y-connected generator. This will be demonstrated when we consider unbalanced Y-connected systems. We shall now examine the four-wire Y-Y-connected system. The cur- rent passing through each phase of the generator is the same as its cor- responding line current, which in turn for a Y-connected load is equal to the current in the phase of the load to which it is attached: (22.6) For a balanced or an unbalanced load, since the generator and load have a common neutral point, then (22.7) In addition, since IfL \u0001 Vf /Zf,the magnitude of the current in each phase will be equal for a balanced load and unequal for an unbal- anced load. You will recall that for the Y-connected generator, the magnitude of the line voltage is equal to \u00013\u0002 times the phase voltage. This same relationship can be applied to a balanced or an unbalanced four-wire Y-connected load: (22.8) Fora voltage drop across a load element, the ﬁrst subscript refers to that terminal through which the current enters the load element, and the second subscript refers to the terminal from which the current leaves. In other words, the ﬁrst subscript is, by deﬁnition, positive with respect to the second for a voltage drop. Note Fig. 22.13, in which the standard dou- ble subscripts for a source of voltage and a voltage drop are indicated.

For this case, however, Kirchhoff’s current law is employed instead of Kirchhoff’s voltage law. The results obtained are (22.11) and the phase angle between a line current and the nearest phase cur- rent is 30°. A more detailed discussion of this relationship between the line and phase currents of a D-connected system can be found in Sec- tion 22.7.

Each wattmeter measures the power delivered to each phase. The potential coil of each wattmeter is connected parallel with the load, while the current coil is in series with the load. The total average power of the system can be found by summing the three wattmeter readings; that is, (22.31) For the load (balanced or unbalanced), the wattmeters are connected as shown in Fig. 22.29.

The basic connections of this two-wattmeter method are shown in Fig. 22.30. One end of each potential coil is con- nected to the same line. The current coils are then placed in the remain- ing lines.

The connection shown in Fig. 22.31 will also satisfy the require- ments. A third hookup is also possible, but this is left to the reader as an exercise. The total power delivered to the load is the algebraic sum of the two wattmeter readings. For a balanced load, we will now consider two THE TWO-WATTMETER METHOD  999 methods of determining whether the total power is the sum or the dif- ference of the two wattmeter readings. The ﬁrst method to be described requires that we know or be able to ﬁnd the power factor (leading or lagging) of any one phase of the load. When this information has been obtained, it can be applied directly to the curve of Fig. 22.32. The curve in Fig. 22.32 is a plot of the power factor of the load (phase) versus the ratio Pl /Ph, where Pl and Ph are the magnitudes of the lower- and higher-reading wattmeters, respectively. Note that for a power factor (leading or lagging) greater than 0.5, the ratio has a posi- tive value. This indicates that both wattmeters are reading positive, and the total power is the sum of the two wattmeter readings; that is, PT \u0001 Pl \u0002 Ph. For a power factor less than 0.5 (leading or lagging), the ratio has a negative value. This indicates that the smaller-reading wattmeter is reading negative, and the total power is the difference of the two wattmeter readings; that is, PT \u0001 Ph \u0003 Pl. A closer examination will reveal that, when the power factor is 1(cos 0° \u0001 1), corresponding to a purely resistive load, Pl /Ph \u0001 1or Pl \u0001 Ph, and both wattmeters will have the same wattage indication. At a power factor equal to 0 (cos 90° \u0001 0), corresponding to a purely reac- tive load, Pl /Ph \u0001\u00031 or Pl \u0001\u0003Ph, and both wattmeters will again have the same wattage indication but with opposite signs. The transition from a negative to a positive ratio occurs when the power factor of the load is 0.5 or v \u0001 cos \u00031 0.5 \u0001 60°. At this power factor, Pl /Ph \u0001 0, so that Pl \u0001 0, while Ph will read the total power delivered to the load. The second method for determining whether the total power is the sum or difference of the two wattmeter readings involves a simple labo- ratory test. For the test to be applied, both wattmeters must ﬁrst have an up-scale deﬂection. If one of the wattmeters has a below-zero indica- tion, an up-scale deﬂection can be obtained by simply reversing the leads of the current coil of the wattmeter. To perform the test: 1. Take notice of which line does not have a current coil sensing the line current. 2. For the lower-reading wattmeter, disconnect the lead of the poten- tial coil connected to the line without the current coil. 3. Take the disconnected lead of the lower-reading wattmeter’s potential coil, and touch a connection point on the line that has the current coil of the higher-reading wattmeter.

Since the neutral is a common point between the load and source, no matter what the impedance of each phase of the load and source, the voltage across each phase is the phase voltage of the generator: (22.34) The phase currents can therefore be determined by Ohm’s law: (22.35) The current in the neutral for any unbalanced system can then be found by applying Kirchhoff’s current law at the common point n: (22.36)IN \u0001 If1 \u0002 If2 \u0002 If3 \u0001 IL1 \u0002 IL 2 \u0002 IL 3 If1 \u0001 \u0005 V Z f 1 1\u0005 \u0001 \u0005 E Z f 1 1\u0005 and so on Vf \u0001 Ef 1002  POLYPHASE SYSTEMS Because of the variety of equipment found in an industrial environ- ment, both three-phase power and single-phase power are usually pro- vided with the single-phase obtained off the three-phase system. In addition, since the load on each phase is continually changing, a four- wire system (with a neutral) is normally employed to ensure steady voltage levels and to provide a path for the current resulting from an unbalanced load. The system of Fig. 22.35 has a three-phase trans- former dropping the line voltage from 13,800 V to 208 V. All the lower- power-demand loads such as lighting, wall outlets, security, etc., use the single-phase, 120-V line to neutral voltage. Higher power loads, such as air conditioners, electric ovens or dryers, etc., use the single-phase, 208 V available from line to line. For larger motors and special high- demand equipment, the full three-phase power can be taken directly off the system, as shown in Fig. 22.35. In the design and construction of a commercial establishment, the National Electric Code requires that every effort be made to ensure that the expected loads, whether they be single- Line IL1 Line Line Neutral IfL1 + – + – + – IN IL2 Vf1 Z1 IL3 IfL2 Vf2 Z2Z3 Vf3 IfL3 EL EL EL FIG. 22.34 Unbalanced Y-connected load. 208 V ∠–120° 208 V ∠120° 208 V ∠0° Secondary 3 transformerφ 1 φ 120 V 1 φ 280 V 1 φ 120 V 1 φ 120 V 208 V balanced load φ3 FIG. 22.35 3f/1f, 208-V/120-V industrial supply.

At ﬁrst expo- sure, logarithms often appear vague and mysterious due to the mathe- matical operations required to ﬁnd the logarithm and antilogarithm using the longhand table approach that is typically taught in mathemat- ics courses. However, almost all of today’s scientiﬁc calculators have the common and natural log functions, eliminating the complexity of applying logarithms and allowing us to concentrate on the positive characteristics of the function. Basic Relationships Let us ﬁrst examine the relationship between the variables of the loga- rithmic function. The mathematical expression N \u0001 (b) x states that the number N is equal to the base b taken to the power x. A few examples: 100 \u0001 (10)2 27 \u0001 (3) 3 54.6 \u0001 (e) 4 where e \u0001 2.7183 If the question were to ﬁnd the power x to satisfy the equation 1200 \u0001 (10)x the value of x could be determined using logarithms in the following manner: x \u0001 log10 1200 \u0001 3.079 revealing that 10 3.079 \u0001 1200 dB Decibels, Filters, and Bode Plots 1018  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS Note that the logarithm was taken to the base 10—the number to be taken to the power of x. There is no limitation to the numerical value of the base except that tables and calculators are designed to handle either a base of 10 (common logarithm, ) or base e \u0001 2.7183 (naturalLOG dB logarithm, ). In review, therefore, (23.1) The base to be employed is a function of the area of application. If a conversion from one base to the other is required, the following equa- tion can be applied: (23.2) The content of this chapter is such that we will concentrate solely on the common logarithm. However, a number of the conclusions are also applicable to natural logarithms. Some Areas of Application The following is a short list of the most common applications of the logarithmic function: 1. This chapter will demonstrate that the use of logarithms permits plotting the response of a system for a range of values that may otherwise be impossible or unwieldy with a linear scale. 2. Levels of power, voltage, and the like, can be compared without dealing with very large or very small numbers that often cloud the true impact of the difference in magnitudes. 3. A number of systems respond to outside stimuli in a nonlinear logarithmic manner. The result is a mathematical model that per- mits a direct calculation of the response of the system to a partic- ular input signal. 4. The response of a cascaded or compound system can be rapidly determined using logarithms if the gain of each stage is known on a logarithmic basis. This characteristic will be demonstrated in an example to follow. Graphs Graph paper is available in the semilog and log-log varieties. Semilog paper has only one log scale, with the other a linear scale. Both scales of log-log paper are log scales. A section of semilog paper appears in Fig. 23.1. Note the linear (even-spaced-interval) vertical scaling and the repeating intervals of the log scale at multiples of 10. The spacing of the log scale is determined by taking the common log (base 10) of the number. The scaling starts with 1, since log10 1 \u0001 0. The distance between 1 and 2 is determined by log10 2 \u0001 0.3010, or approximately 30% of the full distance of a log interval, as shown on the graph. The distance between 1 and 3 is determined by log10 3 \u0001 0.4771, or about 48% of the full width. For future ref- erence, keep in mind that almost 50% of the width of one log inter- valis represented by a 3 rather than by the 5 of a linear scale. In addition, note that the number 5 is about 70% of the full width, and 8is about 90%. Remembering the percentage of full width of the loge x \u0001 2.3 log10 x If N \u0001 (b) x, then x \u0001 logb N.

With increasing frequency levels assigned to each interval, a single graph can provide a frequency plot extending from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, as shown in Fig. 23.2, with particular reference to the 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% levels of each interval. On many log plots, the tick marks for most of the intermediate levels are left off because of space constraints. The following equation can be used to determine the logarithmic level at a particular point between known levels using a ruler or simply estimating the distances. The param- eters are deﬁned by Fig. 23.3. (23.3) The derivation of Eq. (23.3) is simply an extension of the details regard- ing distance appearing on Fig. 23.1.

The common or natural logarithm of the number 1 is 0. (23.4) just as 10x \u0001 1 requires that x \u0001 0. 2.

If there is an increase in power level (P2 > P1), the resulting decibel level is positive. If there is a decrease in power level (P2 < P1), the resulting decibel level will be negative. For the special case of P2 \u0001 2P1, the gain in decibels is dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 2 \u0001 3 dB Therefore, for a speaker system, a 3-dB increase in output would re- quire that the power level be doubled. In the audio industry, it is a generally accepted rule that an increase in sound level is accom- plished with 3-dB increments in the output level. In other words, a 1-dB increase is barely detectable, and a 2-dB increase just dis- cernible. A 3-dB increase normally results in a readily detectable increase in sound level. An additional increase in the sound level is normally accomplished by simply increasing the output level another 3 dB. If an 8-W system were in use, a 3-dB increase would require a 16-W output, whereas an additional increase of 3 dB (a total of 6 dB) would require a 32-W system, as demonstrated by the calcula- tions below: dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 2 \u0001 3 dB dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 4 \u0001 6 dB For P2 \u0001 10P1, dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 10 \u0001 10(1) \u0001 10 dB resulting in the unique situation where the power gain has the same magnitude as the decibel level. For some applications, a reference level is established to permit a comparison of decibel levels from one situation to another. For com- munication systems a commonly applied reference level is Pref \u0001 1 mW (across a 600-\u0007 load) Equation (23.10) is then typically written as P2 \u0006 P1 32 \u0006 8 P2 \u0006 P1 16 \u0006 8 P2 \u0006 P1 P2 \u0006 P1 dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0006 P P 1 2 \u0006 1 bel \u0001 10 decibels (dB) B \u0001 log10 \u0006 P P 1 2 \u0006 dBDECIBELS  1023 dBm \u0001 10 log10 \u0006 1m PW \u0006 \u0001 600 \u0007 (23.11) Note the subscript m to denote that the decibel level is determined with a reference level of 1 mW. In particular, for P \u0001 40 mW, dBm \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 40 \u0001 10(1.6) \u0001 16 dBm whereas for P \u0001 4 W, dBm \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 4000 \u0001 10(3.6) \u0001 36 dBm Even though the power level has increased by a factor of 4000 mW/ 40 mW \u0001 100, the dBm increase is limited to 20 dBm. In time, the sig- niﬁcance of dBm levels of 16 dBm and 36 dBm will generate an imme- diate appreciation regarding the power levels involved. An increase of 20 dBm will also be associated with a signiﬁcant gain in power levels. Voltage Gain Decibels are also used to provide a comparison between voltage levels. Substituting the basic power equations P2 \u0001 V2 2/R2 and P1 \u0001 V2 1/R1 into Eq. (23.10) will result in dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10 V2 2/R2\u0006 V2 1/R1 P2 \u0006 P1 4000 mW\u0006\u0006 1 mW 40 mW\u0006 1 mW dB \u0001 10 log10 \u0001 10 log10\u0002\u0003 2 \u0003 10 log10\u0002\u0003 and dB \u0001 20 log10 \u0003 10 log10 For the situation where R2 \u0001 R1, a condition normally assumed when comparing voltage levels on a decibel basis, the second term of the preceding equation will drop out (log10 1 \u0001 0), and (dB) (23.12) Note the subscript v to deﬁne the decibel level obtained.

In particular, note that when voltage levels are compared, a doubling of the level results in a change of 6 dB rather than 3 dB as obtained for power levels. In addition, note that an increase in gain from 1 to 100,000 results in a change in decibels that can easily be plotted on a single graph. Also note that doubling the gain (from 1 to 2 and 10 to 20) results in a 6-dB increase in the decibel level, while a change of 10 to 1 (from 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and so on) always results in a 20-dB decrease in the decibel level. The Human Auditory Response One of the most frequent applications of the decibel scale is in the com- munication and entertainment industries. The human ear does not respond in a linear fashion to changes in source power level; that is, a doubling of the audio power level from 1/2 W to 1 W does not result in a doubling of the loudness level for the human ear. In addition, a change from 5 W to 10 W will be received by the ear as the same change in sound intensity as experienced from 1/2 W to 1 W. In other words, the ratio between levels is the same in each case (1 W/0.5 W \u0001 10 W/5 W \u0001 2), resulting in the same decibel or logarithmic change deﬁned by Eq. (23.7). The ear, therefore, responds in a logarithmic fashion to changes in audio power levels. To establish a basis for comparison between audio levels, a reference level of 0.0002 microbar (mbar) was chosen, where 1 mbar is equal to the sound pressure of 1 dyne per square centimeter, or about 1 millionth of the normal atmospheric pressure at sea level. The 0.0002-mbar level is the threshold level of hearing. Using this reference level, the sound pressure level in decibels is deﬁned by the following equation: (23.13) where P is the sound pressure in microbars. The decibel levels of Fig. 23.5 are deﬁned by Eq. (23.13). Meters designed to measure audio levels are calibrated to the levels deﬁned by Eq. (23.13) and shown in Fig. 23.5. dBs \u0001 20 log10 \u0006 0.000 P 2 mbar \u0006 6.8 V\u0006 63.096 Vo\u0006 63.096 Vo\u0006 Vi Vo\u0006 Vi Vo\u0006 Vi dB TABLE 23.1 Vo /Vi dB \u0003 20 log10(Vo /Vi) 10 dB 26 dB 10 20 dB 20 26 dB 100 40 dB 1,000 60 dB 100,000 100 dB DECIBELS  1025 A common question regarding audio levels is how much the power level of an acoustical source must be increased to double the sound level received by the human ear. The question is not as simple as it ﬁrst seems due to considerations such as the frequency content of the sound, the acoustical conditions of the surrounding area, the physical characteristics of the surrounding medium, and—of course—the unique characteristics of the human ear. However, a general conclu- sion can be formulated that has practical value if we note the power levels of an acoustical source appearing to the left of Fig. 23.5. Each power level is associated with a particular decibel level, and a change of 10 dB in the scale corresponds with an increase or a decrease in power by a factor of 10. For instance, a change from 90 dB to 100 dB is associated with a change in wattage from 3 W to 30 W. Through experimentation it has been found that on an average basis the loudness level will double for every 10-dB change in audio level—a conclusion somewhat veriﬁed by the examples to the right of Fig. 23.5. Using the fact that a 10-dB change corresponds with a tenfold increase in power level supports the following conclusion (on an approximate basis): Through experimentation it has been found that on an average basis, the loudness level will double for every 10-dB change in audio level. To double the sound level received by the human ear, the power rating of the acoustical source (in watts) must be increased by a factor of 10. dB 160 0 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 Jet engine Community siren Threshold of pain Pneumatic riveter Loud rock band, punch press Chain saw Very loud music Loud music, heavy truck, subway train Orchestra, highway traffic Average conversation Quiet music Average residence, computer system Background music Whispering Faint sounds, paper rustling Quiet office, computer hard drive Threshold of hearing Dynamic range ≅ 120 dBs Output Power.

Instrumentation A number of modern VOMs and DMMs have a dB scale designed to pro- vide an indication of power ratios referenced to a standard level of 1 mW at 600 \u0007. Since the reading is accurate only if the load has a characteris- tic impedance of 600 \u0007,the 1-mW, 600 reference level is normally printed somewhere on the face of the meter, as shown in Fig. 23.6. The dB scale is usually calibrated to the lowest ac scale of the meter. In other dB 1 mW, 600 \u0001 1.5 1 .50 2.0 2.533V A C 6543210 2 4 6 8 12 7 8 9 10 11+DB –DB FIG. 23.6 Deﬁning the relationship between a dB scale referenced to 1 mW, 600 \u0001 and a 3-V-rms voltage scale. words, when making the dB measurement, choose the lowest ac voltage scale, but read the dB scale. If a higher voltage scale is chosen, a correc- tion factor must be employed that is sometimes printed on the face of the meter but always available in the meter manual. If the impedance is other than 600 \u0007 or not purely resistive, other correction factors must be used that are normally included in the meter manual. Using the basic power equation P \u0001 V2/R will reveal that 1 mW across a 600-\u0007 load is the same as applying 0.775 V rms across a 600-\u0007 load; that is, V \u0001 \u0004P\u0005R\u0005 \u0001 \u0004(1\u0005 m\u0005W\u0005)(\u00056\u00050\u00050\u0005\u0007\u0005)\u0005\u0001 0.775 V. The result is that an analog display will have 0 dB [deﬁning the reference point of 1 mW, dB \u0001 10 log10 P2/P1 \u0001 10 log10 (1 mW/1 mW(ref)] \u0001 0 dB] and 0.775 V rms on the same pointer projection, as shown in Fig. 23.6. A voltage of 2.5 V across a 600-\u0007 load would result in a dB level of dB \u0001 20 log10 V2/V1 \u0001 20 log10 2.5 V/0.775 \u0001 10.17 dB, resulting in 2.5 V and 10.17 dB appearing along the same pointer projection. A voltage of less than 0.775 V, such as 0.5 V, will result in a dB level of dB \u0001 20 log10 V2/V1 \u0001 20 log10 0.5 V/0.775 V \u0001\u00033.8 dB, as is also shown on the scale of Fig. 23.6. Although a reading of 10 dB will reveal that the power level is 10 times the reference, don’t assume that a reading of 5 dB means that the output level is5mW. The 10 : 1 ratio is a special one in logarithmic circles. For the 5-dB level, the power level must be found using the antilogarithm (3.126), which reveals that the power level associated with 5 dB is about 3.1 times the reference or 3.1 mW. A conversion table is usually provided in the manual for such conversions. 23.4 FILTERS Any combination of passive (R, L, and C) and/or active (transistors or operational ampliﬁers) elements designed to select or reject a band of FILTERS  1027 frequencies is called a ﬁlter. In communication systems, ﬁlters are employed to pass those frequencies containing the desired information and to reject the remaining frequencies. In stereo systems, ﬁlters can be used to isolate particular bands of frequencies for increased or decreased emphasis by the output acoustical system (ampliﬁer, speaker, etc.). Filters are employed to ﬁlter out any unwanted frequencies, com- monly called noise, due to the nonlinear characteristics of some elec- tronic devices or signals picked up from the surrounding medium. In general, there are two classiﬁcations of ﬁlters: 1. Passive ﬁlters are those ﬁlters composed of series or parallel combinations of R, L, and C elements. 2. Active ﬁlters are ﬁlters that employ active devices such as tran- sistors and operational ampliﬁers in combination with R, L, and C elements. dB Stop-band filter: (d) Vo 0 Vmax 0.707Vmax Pass-band Stop-band Pass-band f1 fo f2 f Pass-band filter: (c) Vo 0 Vmax 0.707Vmax Stop-band Pass-band Stop-band f1 fo f2 f High-pass filter: (b) Vo 0 Vmax 0.707Vmax Stop-band Pass-band fc f Low-pass filter: (a) Vo 0 Vmax 0.707Vmax Pass-band Stop-band fc f FIG. 23.7 Deﬁning the four broad categories of ﬁlters. 1028  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS Since this text is limited to passive devices, the analysis of this chap- ter will be limited to passive ﬁlters. In addition, only the most funda- mental forms will be examined in the next few sections. The subject of ﬁlters is a very broad one that continues to receive extensive research support from industry and the government as new communication sys- tems are developed to meet the demands of increased volume and speed. There are courses and texts devoted solely to the analysis and design of ﬁlter systems that can become quite complex and sophisti- cated. In general, however, all ﬁlters belong to the four broad categories of low-pass, high-pass, pass-band, and stop-band, as depicted in Fig. 23.7. For each form there are critical frequencies that deﬁne the regions of pass-bands and stop-bands (often called reject bands). Any frequency in the pass-band will pass through to the next stage with at least 70.7% of the maximum output voltage. Recall the use of the 0.707 level to deﬁne the bandwidth of a series or parallel resonant circuit (both with the general shape of the pass-band ﬁlter). For some stop-band ﬁlters, the stop-band is deﬁned by conditions other than the 0.707 level. In fact, for many stop-band ﬁlters, the con- dition that Vo \u0001 1/1000Vmax (corresponding with \u000360 dB in the dis- cussion to follow) is used to deﬁne the stop-band region, with the pass- band continuing to be deﬁned by the 0.707-V level. The resulting frequencies between the two regions are then called the transition fre- quencies and establish the transition region. At least one example of each ﬁlter of Fig. 23.7 will be discussed in some detail in the sections to follow. Take particular note of the relative simplicity of some of the designs. 23.5 R-C LOW-PASS FILTER The R-C ﬁlter, incredibly simple in design, can be used as a low-pass or a high-pass ﬁlter. If the output is taken off the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 23.8, it will respond as a low-pass ﬁlter. If the positions of the resistor and capacitor are interchanged and the output is taken off the resistor, the response will be that of a high-pass ﬁlter. A glance at Fig. 23.7(a) reveals that the circuit should behave in a manner that will result in a high-level output for low frequencies and a declining level for frequencies above the critical value. Let us ﬁrst examine the network at the frequency extremes of f \u0001 0 Hz and very high frequencies to test the response of the circuit. At f \u0001 0 Hz, XC \u0001\u0001 ∞ \u0007 and the open-circuit equivalent can be substituted for the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 23.9, resulting in Vo \u0001 Vi. At very high frequencies, the reactance is XC \u0001 \u0006 0 \u0007 and the short-circuit equivalent can be substituted for the capacitor, as shown in Fig. 23.10, resulting in Vo \u0001 0 V. A plot of the magnitude of Vo versus frequency will result in the curve of Fig. 23.11. Our next goal is now clearly deﬁned: Find the frequency at which the transition takes place from a pass-band to a stop-band. 1\u0006 2pfC 1\u0006 2pfC dB – + R C Vo – + FIG. 23.8 Low-pass ﬁlter. – + R Vi – + Vo = Vi FIG. 23.9 R-C low-pass ﬁlter at low frequencies. – + R Vi – + Vo = 0 V FIG. 23.10 R-C low-pass ﬁlter at high frequencies. R-C LOW-PASS FILTER  1029 For ﬁlters, a normalized plot is employed more often than the plot of Vo versus frequency of Fig. 23.11. Normalization is a process whereby a quantity such as voltage, current, or impedance is divided by a quantity of the same unit of measure to establish a dimensionless level of a speciﬁc value or range. A normalized plot in the ﬁlter domain can be obtained by dividing the plotted quantity such as Vo of Fig. 23.11 with the applied voltage Vi for the frequency range of interest. Since the maximum value of Vo for the low-pass ﬁlter of Fig. 23.8 is Vi, each level of Vo in Fig. 23.11 is divided by the level of Vi. The result is the plot of Av \u0001 Vo/Vi of Fig. 23.12. Note that the maximum value is 1 and the cutoff frequency is deﬁned at the 0.707 level. dB 0 Vo Vo = 0.707Vi Pass-band Stop-band f (log scale)fc FIG. 23.11 Vo versus frequency for a low-pass R-C ﬁlter.

The frequency at which XC \u0001 R is determined by \u0006 2p 1 fcC \u0006 \u0001 R and (23.16) The impact of Eq. (23.16) extends beyond its relative simplicity. For any low-pass ﬁlter, the application of any frequency less than fc will result in an output voltage Vo that is at least 70.7% of the maximum. For any frequency above fc, the output is less than 70.7% of the applied signal. Solving for Vo and substituting Vi \u0001 Vi \u00010° gives Vo \u0001 \u0007 \u0001v\bVi \u0001 \u0007 \u0001v\bVi \u00010° and Vo \u0001 \u0001v The angle v is, therefore, the angle by which Vo leads Vi. Since v \u0001 \u0003tan \u00031 R/XC is always negative (except at f \u0001 0 Hz), it is clear that Vo will always lag Vi, leading to the label lagging network for the network of Fig. 23.8. At high frequencies, XC is very small and R/XC is quite large, result- ing in v \u0001\u0003tan \u00031 R/XC approaching \u000390°. At low frequencies, XC is quite large and R/XC is very small, result- ing in v approaching 0°. At XC \u0001 R, or f \u0001 fc, \u0003tan\u00031 R/XC \u0001\u0003tan\u00031 1 \u0001\u000345°. A plot of v versus frequency results in the phase plot of Fig. 23.13. The plot is of Vo leading Vi, but since the phase angle is always neg- ative, the phase plot of Fig. 23.14 (Vo lagging Vi) is more appropriate. Note that a change in sign requires that the vertical axis be changed to the angle by which Vo lags Vi. In particular, note that the phase angle between Vo and Vi is less than 45° in the pass-band and approaches 0° XCVi\u0006\u0006 \u0004R\u0005 2 \u0005\u0004\u0005X\u0005 2 C\u0005 XC\u0006\u0006 \u0004R\u0005 2 \u0005\u0004\u0005X\u0005 2 C\u0005 XC\u0006\u0006 \u0004R\u0005 2 \u0005\u0004\u0005X\u0005 2 C\u0005 fc \u0001 \u0006 2p 1 RC \u0006 1 \u0006 \u00042\u0005 1\u0006 \u00041\u0005\u0004\u0005 1\u0005 1—— \t\u0002 \u0006 X R C \u0006 \u0003 2 \u0004 1 v \u0001\u000390° \u0004 tan \u00031 \u0006 X R C \u0006 \u0001\u0003tan \u00031 \u0006 X R C \u0006 1—— \t\u0002 \u0006 X R C \u0006 \u0003 2 \u0004 1 XC\u0006\u0006 \u0004R\u0005 2 \u0005\u0004\u0005X\u0005 2 C\u0005 Vo\u0006 Vi dBR-C LOW-PASS FILTER  1031 at lower frequencies.

PASS-BAND FILTERS  1037 pass ﬁlter but have little effect on Vo due to the reject characteristics of the high-pass ﬁlter. A frequency f2 may pass through the high-pass ﬁl- ter unmolested but be prohibited from reaching the high-pass ﬁlter by the low-pass characteristics. A frequency fo near the center of the pass- band will pass through both ﬁlters with very little degeneration. The network of Example 23.7 will generate the characteristics of Fig. 23.29. However, for a circuit such as the one shown in Fig. 23.30, there is a loading between stages at each frequency that will affect the level of Vo. Through proper design, the level of Vo may be very near the level of Vi in the pass-band, but it will never equal it exactly. In addi- tion, as the critical frequencies of each ﬁlter get closer and closer together to increase the quality factor of the response curve, the peak values within the pass-band will continue to drop. For cases where Vomax \u0001 Vimax the bandwidth is deﬁned at 0.707 of the resulting Vomax. EXAMPLE 23.7 For the pass-band ﬁlter of Fig. 23.30: a. Determine the critical frequencies for the low- and high-pass ﬁlters. b. Using only the critical frequencies, sketch the response characteris- tics. c.

The pass-band response can also be obtained using the series and parallel resonant circuits discussed in Chapter 20. In each case, how- ever, Vo will not be equal to Vi in the pass-band, but a frequency range in which Vo will be equal to or greater than 0.707Vmax can be deﬁned.

However, rather than the cascaded conﬁguration used for the pass-band ﬁlter, a parallel arrangement is required, as shown in Fig. 23.38. A low-frequency f1 can pass through the low-pass ﬁlter, and a higher-frequency f2 can use the parallel path, as shown in Figs. 23.38 and 23.39. However, a frequency such as fo in the reject-band is higher than the low-pass critical frequency and lower than the high-pass criti- cal frequency, and is therefore prevented from contributing to the levels of Vo above 0.707Vmax. dB 0.943 0.667 0 fs f (log scale) Av = Vo Vi = Vo 20 mV (a) 1 0.707 0 fs f (log scale) (b) Av = = Av Avmax Av 0.943 BW{BW{ FIG. 23.37 Normalized plots for the pass-band ﬁlter of Fig. 23.35.

For the parallel resonant circuit, at f \u0001 0 Hz, the coil can be replaced by a short-circuit equivalent, and the capacitor can be replaced by its open circuit and Vo \u0001 RVi /(R \u0002 Rl). At the high-frequency end, the capacitor approaches a short-circuit equivalent, and Vo increases toward Vi. 23.9 DOUBLE-TUNED FILTER Some network conﬁgurations display both a pass-band and a stop-band characteristic, such as shown in Fig. 23.43. Such networks are called double-tuned ﬁlters. For the network of Fig. 23.43(a), the parallel res- onant circuit will establish a stop-band for the range of frequencies not permitted to establish a signiﬁcant VL. The greater part of the applied voltage will appear across the parallel resonant circuit for this fre- quency range due to its very high impedance compared with RL. For the pass-band, the parallel resonant circuit is designed to be capacitive (inductive if Ls is replaced by Cs). The inductance Ls is chosen to can- cel the effects of the resulting net capacitive reactance at the resonant pass-band frequency of the tank circuit, thereby acting as a series reso- nant circuit. The applied voltage will then appear across RL at this fre- quency. Vomin \u0001 \u0003 R \u0002 RV Z i Tp \u0003 Vomin \u0001 \u0003 Rl R \u0002 lViR \u0003 FIG. 23.43 Double-tuned networks.

The curves obtained for the magnitude and/or phase angle versus frequency are called Bode plots (Fig. 23.44). Through the use of straight-line segments called idealized Bode plots, the frequency response of a system can be found efﬁciently and accurately. To ensure that the derivation of the method is correctly and clearly understood, the ﬁrst network to be analyzed will be examined in some detail. The second network will be treated in a shorthand manner, and ﬁnally a method for quickly determining the response will be intro- duced. 1414.7 \u0004\u0003\u0003 (2p)(200 kHz) XLp\u0003 q 1\u0003\u0003\u0003 (2p)(200 kHz)(500 pF) 1 \u0003 qC 1\u0003\u0003\u0003 4p 2(600 kHz)2(500 pF) 1\u0003 4p 2f 2 sC 1\u0003 2p\u0001L\u0002C\u0002 dB FIG. 23.44 Hendrik Wade Bode American (Madison, WI; Summit, NJ; Cambridge, MA) (1905–81) V.P. at Bell Laboratories Professor of Systems Engineering, Harvard University Courtesy of AT&T Archives In his early years at Bell Laboratories, Hendrik Bode wasinvolved with electric ﬁlter and equalizer de- sign.

(23.35) and the basic equation for gain in decibels: GdB \u0001 20 log10 Vo/Vi. The comments regarding changes in decibel levels due to changes in Vo/Vi can therefore be applied here also, except now a change in frequency by a 2\u00021 ratio will result in a 6-dB change in gain. A change in frequency by a 10\u00021 ratio will result in a 20-dB change in gain. Two frequencies separated by a 2:1 ratio are said to be an octave apart. For Bode plots, a change in frequency by one octave will result in a 6-dB change in gain. Two frequencies separated by a 10:1 ratio are said to be a decade apart. For Bode plots, a change in frequency by one decade will result in a 20-dB change in gain. One may wonder about all the mathematical development to obtain an equation that initially appears confusing and of limited value. As speciﬁed, Equation (23.35) is accurate only for frequency levels much less than fc. First, realize that the mathematical development of Eq. (23.35) will not have to be repeated for each conﬁguration encountered. Second, the equation itself is seldom applied but simply used in a manner to be described to deﬁne a straight line on a log plot that permits a sketch of the frequency response of a system with a minimum of effort and a high degree of accuracy. To plot Eq. (23.35), consider the following levels of increasing fre- quency: For f \u0001 fc /10, f/fc \u0001 0.1 and \u000220 log10 0.1 \u0001\u000520 dB For f \u0001 fc /4, f/fc \u0001 0.25 and \u000220 log10 0.25 \u0001\u000512 dB For f \u0001 fc /2, f/fc \u0001 0.51 and \u000220 log10 0.5 \u0001\u00056 dB For f \u0001 fc, f/fc \u0001 1 and \u000220 log10 1 \u0001 0 dB f \u0003 fc 1 \u0003 b fc\u0003 f fc\u0003 f fc\u0003 f fc\u0003 f dBBODE PLOTS  1047 Note from the above equations that as the frequency of interest approaches fc, the dB gain becomes less negative and approaches the ﬁnal normalized value of 0 dB. The positive sign in front of Eq. (23.35) can therefore be interpreted as an indication that the dB gain will have a positive slope with an increase in frequency. A plot of these points on a log scale will result in the straight-line segment of Fig. 23.46 to the left of fc. dB FIG. 23.46 Idealized Bode plot for the low-frequency region. –7 dB 0 f (log scale) –3 –6 –9 –12 –15 –18 Actual frequency response –6 dB/octave or –20 dB/decade –21 +20 log10 fc 10 fc 4 fc 2 fc 2 fc 3 fc 5 fc 10 fc –20 log10 1 = 0 dB Idealized Bode plotAv(dB) (linear scale) f fc –20 –1 dB For the future, note that the resulting plot is a straight line intersect- ing the 0-dB line at fc.

In other words, once fc is determined, ﬁnd fc /2, and a plot point exists at \u00056 dB (or ﬁnd fc /10, and a plot point exists at \u000520 dB). Bode plots are straight-line segments because the dB change per decade or octave is constant.

The phase response can also be sketched using straight-line asymp- totes by considering a few critical points in the frequency spectrum.

Deﬁning f K fc for f \u0001 fc /10 (and less) and f k fc for f \u0001 10fc (and more), we can deﬁne an asymptote at v \u0002 90° for f K fc /10, an asymptote at v \u0002 0° for f k 10fc, and an asymptote from fc /10 to 10fc that passes through v \u0002 45° at f \u0002 fc. The asymptotes deﬁned above all appear in Fig. 23.47. Again, the Bode plot for Eq.(23.36) is a straight line because the change in phase angle will be 45° for every tenfold change in frequency.

One good example is the high- and low-frequency response of a standard transistor conﬁguration. Some capacitive elements in a practical transistor network will affect the low-frequency response, and others will affect the high-frequency response. In the absence of the capacitive elements, the frequency response of a transistor would ideally stay level at the midband value. However, the coupling capacitors at low frequencies and the bypass and parasitic capacitors at high frequencies will deﬁne a bandwidth for numerous transistor conﬁgurations. In the low-frequency region, spe- ciﬁc capacitors and resistors will form an R-C combination that will deﬁne a low cutoff frequency. There are then other elements and capacitors forming a second R-C combination that will deﬁne a high cutoff frequency. Once the cutoff frequencies are known, the \u00053-dB points are set, and the bandwidth of the system can be deter- mined. 23.11 SKETCHING THE BODE RESPONSE In the previous section we found that normalized functions of the form appearing in Fig. 23.54 had the Bode envelope and the dB response dB dB –3 dB fc f –6 dB/octave (for increasing f) 1 (a) Low-pass: 1 + j f fc dB 0 dBfc f +6 dB/octave (for increasing f) 1 (b) High-pass: 1 + j f fc –3 dB FIG. 23.54 dB response of (a) low-pass ﬁlter and (b) high-pass ﬁlter. indicated in the same ﬁgure. In this section we introduce additional functions and their responses that can be used in conjunction with those of Fig. 23.54 to determine the dB response of more sophisticated sys- tems in a systematic, time-saving, and accurate manner. As an avenue toward introducing an additional function that appears quite frequently, let us examine the high-pass ﬁlter of Fig. 23.55 which has a high-frequency output less than the full applied voltage. Before developing a mathematical expression for Av \u0001 Vo /Vi, let us ﬁrst make a rough sketch of the expected response.

For all the plots obtained in the previous section, Vi was the maximum value, and the ratio Vo /Vi had a maximum value of 1. For many situa- tions, this will not be the case, and we must be aware of which ratio is being plotted versus frequency. The dB response curves for the plots of Figs. 23.57(b) and 23.57(c) can both be obtained quite directly using the foundation established by the conclusions depicted in Fig. 23.54, butwe must be aware of what to expect and how they will differ.

On most data sheets and for the majority of the investigative techniques commonly employed, the normalized plot of Fig. 23.57(c) is used because it establishes 0 dB as an asymptote for the dB plot. To ensure that the impact of using either Fig. 23.57(b) or Fig. 23.57(c) in a fre- quency plot is understood, the analysis of the ﬁlter of Fig. 23.55 will include the resulting dB plot for both normalized curves.

If we divide both sides by Avmax \u0001 R2/(R1 \u0002 R2), we have (23.42) from which the magnitude plot of Fig. 23.57(c) can be obtained. Based on the past section, a dB plot of the magnitude of A′v \u0001 Av/Avmax is now quite direct using Fig. 23.54(b). The plot appears in Fig. 23.58. For the gain Av \u0001 Vo /Vi , we can apply Eq.

The numerator, however, is a new func- tion that will deﬁne a unique Bode asymptote that will prove useful for a variety of network conﬁgurations. Applying Eq.

Note that the asymptote passes through the 0-dB line at f \u0001 f1 and has a positive slope of \u00026 dB/octave (or 20 dB/decade) for frequencies above and below f1 for increasing values of f. If we examine the original function Av, we ﬁnd that the phase angle associated with jf/f1 \u0001 f/f1 \u000190° is ﬁxed at 90°, resulting in a phase angle for Av of 90° \u0005 tan \u00051( f/fc) \u0001\u0002tan\u00051( fc /f ). Now that we have a plot of the dB response for the magnitude of the function f/f1, we can plot the dB response of the magnitude of Av using a procedure outlined by Fig. 23.61. Solving for f1 and fc: f1 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 39.79 kHz with fc \u0001\u0001 \u0001 31.83 kHz For this development the straight-line asymptotes for each term resulting from the application of Eq. (23.5) will be drawn on the same frequency axis to permit an examination of the impact of one line sec- tion on the other. For clarity, the frequency spectrum of Fig. 23.61 has been divided into two regions. In region 1 we have a 0-dB asymptote and one increasing at 6 dB/octave for increasing frequencies. The sum of the two as deﬁned by Eq. (23.5) is simply the 6-dB/octave asymptote shown in the ﬁgure. 1\u0003\u0003 2p(5 k\u0004)(1 nF) 1\u0003\u0003 2p(R1 \u0002 R2)C 1\u0003\u0003 2p(4 k\u0004)(1 nF) 1\u0003 2pR2C f \u0003 f1 1 \u0003 2 f \u0003 f1 f \u0003 f1 1\u0003\u0003 \u00011\u0002\u0002\u0002 (\u0002f /\u0002fc\u0002) 2 \u0002 1\u0003\u0003 \u00011\u0002\u0002\u0002 (\u0002f /\u0002fc\u0002) 2 \u0002 f \u0003 f1 Vo\u0003 Vi 1\u0003\u0003 2p(R1 \u0002 R2)C 1\u0003 2pR2C Av \u0001 \u0003 V V o i \u0003\u0001 \u0003 1 \u0002 j (j f/ ( f1 f) /fc) \u0003 dB f1 f 0 dB 20 log10 f f1 +6 dB/octave FIG. 23.60 dB plot of f/f1. LOW-PASS FILTER WITH LIMITED ATTENUATION  1057 In region 2 one asymptote is increasing at 6 dB, and the other is decreasing at \u00056 dB/octave for increasing frequencies. The net effect is that one cancels the other for the region greater than f \u0001 fc, leaving a horizontal asymptote beginning at f \u0001 fc.A careful sketch of the asymptotes on a log scale will reveal that the horizontal asymptote is at \u00051.94 dB, as obtained earlier for the same function. The horizontal level can also be determined by simply plugging f \u0001 fc into the Bode plot deﬁned by f/f1;that is, 20 log \u0001 20 log10 \u0001 20 log10 \u0001 20 log10 0.799 \u0001\u00051.94 dB The actual response can then be drawn using the asymptotes and the known differences at f \u0001 fc (\u00053 dB) and at f \u0001 0.5fc or 2fc (\u00051 dB). In summary, therefore, the same dB response for Av \u0001 Vo /Vi can be obtained by isolating the maximum value or deﬁning the gain in a dif- ferent form. The latter approach permitted the introduction of a new function for our catalog of idealized Bode plots that will prove useful in the future. 23.12 LOW-PASS FILTER WITH LIMITED ATTENUATION Our analysis will now continue with the low-pass ﬁlter of Fig. 23.62, which has limited attentuation at the high-frequency end. That is, the output will not drop to zero as the frequency becomes relatively high. The ﬁlter is similar in construction to Fig. 23.55, but note that now Vo includes the capacitive element.

In region 1 of Fig. 23.65, both asymptotes are at 0 dB, resulting in a net Bode asymptote at 0 dB for the region. At f \u0001 fc , one asymptote maintains its 0-dB level, whereas the other is dropping by 6 dB/octave. The sum of the two is the 6-dB drop per octave shown for the region. In region 3 the \u00056-dB/octave asymptote is balanced by the \u00026-dB/octave asymptote, establishing a level asymptote at the negative dB level attained by the fc asymptote at f \u0001 f1. The dB level of the horizontal asymptote in region 3 can be determined using Eq. (23.46) or by simply substituting f \u0001 f1 into the asymptotic expression deﬁned by fc. The full idealized Bode envelope is now deﬁned, permitting a sketch of the actual response by simply shifting 3 dB in the right direction at each corner frequency, as shown in Fig. 23.65. The phase angle associated with Av can be determined directly from Eq. (23.45). That is, (23.47) A full plot of v versus frequency can be obtained by simply substi- tuting various key frequencies into Eq. (23.47) and plotting the result on a log scale. The ﬁrst term of Eq.

Now that we have an asymptotic plot for the phase angle of the numerator, we can plot the full phase response by sketching the asymp- totes for both functions of Eq. (23.45) on the same graph, as shown in Fig. 23.67. The asymptotes of Fig. 23.67 clearly indicate that the phase angle will be 0° in the low-frequency range and 0° (90° \u0005 90° \u0001 0°) in the high-frequency range. In region 2 the phase plot drops below 0° due to the impact of the fc asymptote. In region 4 the phase angle increases since the asymptote due to fc remains ﬁxed at \u000590°, whereas that due to f1 is increasing.

Due to the equal and opposite slopes of the asymptotes in the midregion, the angles of f1 and fc will be the same, but note that they are less than 45°. The maximum negative angle will occur between f1 and fc. The remaining points on the curve of Fig. 23.67 can be determined by simply substituting speciﬁc frequencies into Eq. (23.45). However, it is also useful to know that the most dramatic (the quickest) changes in the phase angle occur when the dB plot of the magnitude also goes through its greatest changes (such as at f1 and fc). 23.13 HIGH-PASS FILTER WITH LIMITED ATTENUATION The ﬁlter of Fig. 23.68 is designed to limit the low-frequency attenua- tion in much the same manner as described for the low-pass ﬁlter of the previous section. At f \u0001 0 Hz the capacitor can assume its open-circuit equivalence, and Vo \u0001 [R2/(R1 \u0002 R2)]Vi. At high frequencies the capacitor can be approximated by a short-circuit equivalence, and Vo \u0001 Vi. The resistance to be employed when determining fc can be found by ﬁnding the Thévenin resistance for the capacitor C, as shown in Fig. 23.69.

(23.48) on the same frequency axis, as shown in Fig. 23.72. Note that fc must be more than f1 since R1 \u0002 R2 must be less than R1. When determining the linearized Bode response, let us ﬁrst exam- ine region 2, where one function is 0 dB and the other is dropping at 6 dB/octave for decreasing frequencies. The result is a decreasing asymptote from fc to f1.Atthe intersection of the resultant of region 2 with f1,we enter region 1, where the asymptotes have opposite slopes and cancel the effect of each other. The resulting level at f1 is deter- mined by \u000520 log10(R1 \u0002 R2)/R2,asfound in earlier sections.

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (23.49) deﬁnes the phase angle established by the numerator of Eq. (23.48). The asymptotic plot resulting from the numerator is provided in Fig. 23.73.

Now that we have an asymptotic plot for the phase angle of the numerator, we can plot the full phase response by sketching the asymp- totes for both functions of Eq. (23.48) on the same graph, as shown in Fig. 23.74. The asymptotes of Fig. 23.74 clearly indicate that the phase angle will be 90° in the low-frequency range and 0° (90° \u0005 90° \u0001 0°) in the high-frequency range. In region 2 the phase angle is increasing above 0° because one angle is ﬁxed at 90° and the other is becoming less nega- tive. In region 4 one is 0° and the other is decreasing, resulting in a decreasing v for this region. In region 3 the positive angle is always greater than the negative angle, resulting in a positive angle for the entire region. Since the slopes of the asymptotes in region 3 are equal but opposite, the angles at fc and f1 are the same. Figure 23.74 reveals that the angle at fc and f1 will be less than 45°. The maximum angle will occur between fc and f1, as shown in the ﬁgure. Note again that the greatest change in v occurs at the corner frequencies, matching the regions of greatest change in the dB plot.

Although the previous sec- tions did not cover all the functions that lend themselves to the ideal- ized linear asymptotes, many of those most commonly encountered have been introduced. We now examine some of the special situations that can develop that will further demonstrate the adaptability and usefulness of the linear Bode approach to frequency analysis. OTHER PROPERTIES AND A SUMMARY TABLE  1067 In all the situations described in this chapter, there was only one term in the numerator or denominator. For situations where there is more than one term, there will be an interaction between functions that must be examined and understood. In many cases the use of Eq. (23.5) will prove useful. For example, if Av should have the format Av \u0001\u0001 (23.50) we can expand the function in the following manner: AvdB \u0001 20 log10 \u0001 20 log10 a \u0002 20 log10 b \u000220 log10 c \u0003 20 log10 d \u0003 20 log10 e revealing that the net or resultant dB level is equal to the algebraic sum of the contributions from all the terms of the original function. We will, therefore, be able to add algebraically the linearized Bode plots of all the terms in each frequency interval to determine the idealized Bode plot for the full function. If two terms happen to have the same format and corner frequency, as in the function Av \u0001 the function can be rewritten as Av \u0001 so that AvdB \u0001 20 log10 \u0001\u000320 log10(1 \u0002 ( f1/f ) 2) for f K f1, ( f1/f ) 2 k 1, and AvdB \u0001\u000320 log10( f1/f ) 2 \u0001\u000340 log10 f1/f versus the \u000320 log10( f1/f ) obtained for a single term in the denominator. The resulting dB asymptote will drop, therefore, at a rate of \u000312 dB/ octave (\u000340 dB/decade) for decreasing frequencies rather than \u00036 dB/octave. The corner frequency is the same, and the high-frequency asymptote is still at 0 dB. The idealized Bode plot for the above func- tion is provided in Fig. 23.78. Note the steeper slope of the asymptote and the fact that the actual curve will now pass \u00036dB below the corner frequency rather than \u00033 dB, as for a single term. Keep in mind that if the corner frequencies of the two terms in the numerator or denominator are close but not exactly equal, the total dB drop is the algebraic sum of the contributing terms of the expansion. For instance, consider the linearized Bode plot of Fig. 23.79 with cor- ner frequencies f1 and f2. In region 3 both asymptotes are 0 dB, resulting in an asymptote at 0dB for frequencies greater than f2.For region 2, one asymptote is at 0 dB, whereas the other drops at \u00036 dB/octave for decreasing fre- quencies. The net result for this region is an asymptote dropping at \u00036 dB, as shown in the same ﬁgure. At f1,weﬁnd two asymptotes dropping off at \u00036dB for decreasing frequencies. The result is an asymptote dropping off at \u000312 dB/octave for this region. 1\u0004\u0004 (\u00011\u0002\u0002\u0002 (\u0002f1\u0002/f\u0002) 2\u0002) 2 1\u0004\u0004 (1 \u0003 jf1/f ) 2 1\u0004\u0004\u0004 (1 \u0003 jf1/f )(1 \u0003 jf1/f ) (a)(b)(c)\u0004 (d )(e) (a)(b)(c)\u0004 (d )(e) 200(1 \u0003 jf2/f )( jf/f1)\u0004\u0004\u0004 (1 \u0003 jf1/f )(1 \u0002 jf/f2) dB dB1068  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS If f1 and f2 are at least two octaves apart, the effect of one on the plotting of the actual response for the other can just about be ignored. In other words, for this example, if f1 < f2, then the actual response will be down \u00033 dB at f \u0001 f2 and f1. The above discussion can be expanded for any number of terms at the same frequency or in the same region. For three equal terms in the denominator, the asymptote will drop at \u000318 dB/octave, and so on. In time the procedure will be somewhat self-evident and relatively straightforward to apply. In many cases the hardest part of ﬁnding a solution is to put the original function in the desired form. 1 \u0004 4 AvdB 0 f1 1 2 f1 0 dB Actual response –6 dB –12 dB/octave –2 dB –12 dB –6 dB –6 dB/octave FIG. 23.78 Plotting the linearized Bode plot of . 1\u0004\u0004 (1 \u0003 j (f1/f))2 FIG. 23.79 Plot of AvdB for with f1 < f2. 1\u0004\u0004\u0004 (1 \u0003 j(f1/f))(1 \u0003 j(f2/f)) 0 f1 f2 0 dB f –3 dB for f1 ≤ 1 4 f2 (2 octaves below) –6 dB/octave –3 dB for f1 ≤ 1 4 f2 (2 octaves below) –12 dB/octave Actual response AvdB OTHER PROPERTIES AND A SUMMARY TABLE  1069 EXAMPLE 23.12 A transistor ampliﬁer has the following gain: dB a.

Plotting all the idealized Bode plots on the same axis will result in the plot of Fig. 23.81. Note for frequencies less than 50 Hz that the resulting asymptote drops off at \u000312 dB/octave. In addition, since 50 Hz and 200 Hz are separated by two octaves, the actual response will be down by only about \u00033 dB at the corner frequen- cies of 50 Hz and 200 Hz.

Figure 23.80 demon- strates how the combination of the two types of functions deﬁnes a bandwidth for the ampliﬁer.

Since 10 kHz is one octave below 20 kHz, we can use the fact that the difference between the idealized response and the actual response for a single corner frequency is 1 dB. If we add an addi- tional \u00031-dB drop due to the 20-kHz corner frequency to the \u00033-dB drop at f \u0001 10 kHz, we can conclude that the drop at 10 kHz will be \u00034 dB, as shown on the plot. To check the conclusion, let us write the full expression for the dB level at 10 kHz and ﬁnd the actual level for comparison purposes.

For the low-frequency region an examination of the ﬁrst two terms is sufﬁcient. Proceeding in a similar fashion, we ﬁnd a \u00034-dB difference at f \u0001 20 kHz, resulting in the actual response appearing in Fig. 23.81. Since the bandwidth is deﬁned at the \u00033-dB level, a judg- ment must be made as to where the actual response crosses the \u00033-dB level in the high-frequency region. A rough sketch sug- gests that it is near 8.5 kHz.

In the midregion the phase plot is close to 0° (Vo in phase with Vi), much like the response to a common-base tran- sistor ampliﬁer. In an effort to consolidate some of the material introduced in this chapter and provide a reference for future investigations, Table 23.2 was developed; it includes the linearized dB and phase plots for the functions appearing in the ﬁrst column. These are by no means all the functions encountered, but they do provide a foundation to which addi- tional functions can be added. Reviewing the development of the ﬁlters of Sections 23.12 and 23.13, it is probably evident that establishing the function Av in the proper form is the most difﬁcult part of the analysis. However, with practice and an awareness of the desired format, methods will surface that will signiﬁcantly reduce the effort involved. 23.15 CROSSOVER NETWORKS The topic of crossover networks is included primarily to present an excellent demonstration of ﬁlter operation without a high level of com- plexity. Crossover networks are employed in audio systems to ensure that the proper frequencies are channeled to the appropriate speaker. Although less expensive audio systems have to rely on one speaker to cover the full audio range from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz, better systems will employ at least three speakers to cover the low range (20 Hz to about 500 Hz), the midrange (500 Hz to about 5 kHz), and the high range (5 kHz and up). The term crossover comes from the fact that the system is designed to have a crossover of frequency spectrums for adja- cent speakers at the \u00033-dB level, as shown in Fig. 23.83. Depending on the design, each ﬁlter can drop off at 6 dB, 12 dB, or 18 dB, with com- plexity increasing with the desired dB drop-off rate. The three-way crossover network of Fig. 23.83 is quite simple in design, with a low- pass R-L ﬁlter for the woofer, an R-L-C pass-band ﬁlter for the midrange, and a high-pass R-C ﬁlter for the tweeter. The basic equa- tions for the components are provided below. Note the similarity between the equations, with the only difference for each type of ele- ment being the cutoff frequency.

The total loading on the source is obviously a func- tion of the frequency applied, but the total delivered is determined solely by the speakers since they are essentially resistive in nature.

There are two general types: passive and active. The passive type uses only resistors, while the active type uses electronic devices such as transistors and integrated circuits. Since electronics is a subject for the courses to follow, our attention here will be only on the resistive type. Attenuators are commonly used in audio equipment (such as the graphic and parametric equalizers introduced in the previous chapter), antenna systems, AM or FM systems where attenuation may be required before the signals are mixed, and any other application where a reduction in signal strength is required. The unit of Fig. 23.84 has coaxial input and output terminals and switches to set the level of dB reduction. It has a ﬂat response from dc to about 6 GHz, which essentially means that its introduction into the network will not affect the frequency response for this band of frequen- cies. The design is rather simple with resistors connected in either a tee (T) or a wye (Y) conﬁguration as shown in Figs. 23.85 and 23.86, respectively, for a 50-\u0005 coaxial system.

That is, the input and output impedances of each conﬁguration will be 50 \u0005. For a number of dB attenuations, the resistor values for the T and Y are provided in Figs. 23.85 and 23.86. Note in each design that two of the resistors are the same, while the third is a much smaller or larger value.

As mentioned earlier, there are other methods for attenuation that are more sophisticated in design and beyond the scope of the coverage of this text. However, the above designs are quite effective and relatively inexpensive, and they perform the task at hand quite well. Noise Filters Noise is a problem that can occur in any electronic system. In general, it is the presence of any unwanted signal that can affect the overall operation of a system. It can come from a power source (60-Hz hum), from feedback networks, from mechanical systems connected to elec- trical systems, from stray capacitive and inductive effects, or possibly from a local signal source that is not properly shielded—the list is end- less. The manner in which the noise is eliminated or handled is nor- mally analyzed by someone with a broad practical background and with a sense for the origin for the unwanted noise and how to remove it in the simplest and most direct way. In most cases the problem will not be part of the original design but a second effort in the testing phase to remove unexpected problems. Although sophisticated methods can be applied when the problem can be serious in nature, most situations are handled simply by the proper placement of an element or two of a value sensitive to the problem. In Fig. 23.89 two capacitors have been strategically placed in the tape recording and playback sections of a tape recorder to remove the dB (b) R3 Playback head P R P R Rs CC Coupling capacitor Amplifier and notch filter Filter to reduce stray pickup 100 pF Cs Playback phase Short circuit to high-frequency noiseCn C1 100 pF Compensation control of high frequencies R1 R2 CC Applied signal Recording head P R P R R3 Playback network Record phase (a) Coupling capacitor FIG. 23.89 Noise reduction in a tape recorder. 1078  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS dB undesirable high-frequency noise (rushing sound) that can result from unexpected, randomly placed particles on a magnetic tape, noise com- ing down the line, or noise introduced from the local environment. Dur- ing the record mode, with the switches in the positions shown (R), the 100-pF capacitor at the top of the schematic will act as a short circuit to the high-frequency noise. The capacitor C1 is included to compensate for the fact that recording on a tape is not a linear process versus fre- quency. In other words, certain frequencies are recorded at higher amplitudes than others. In Fig. 23.90 a sketch of recording level versus frequency has been provided, clearly indicating that the human audio range of about 40 Hz to 20 kHz is very poor for the tape recording process, starting to rise only after 20 kHz. Thus, tape recorders must include a ﬁxed biasing fre- quency which when added to the actual audio signal will bring the fre- quency range to be ampliﬁed to the region of high-amplitude recording. On some tapes the actual bias frequency is provided, while on others the phrase normal bias is used. Even after you pass the bias frequency, there is a frequency range that follows that drops off considerably. Compensation for this drop-off is provided by the parallel combination of the resistor R1 and the capacitor C1 mentioned above. At frequencies near the bias frequency, the capacitor is designed to act essentially like an open circuit (high reactance), and the head current and voltage are limited by the resistors R1 and R2. At frequencies in the region where the tape gain drops off with frequency, the capacitor begins to take on a lower reactance level and reduce the net impedance across the parallel branch of R1 and C1. The result is an increase in head current and volt- age due to the lower net impedance in the line, resulting in a leveling in the tape gain following the bias frequency. Eventually, the capacitor will begin to take on the characteristics of a short circuit, effectively shorting out the resistance R1, and the head current and voltage will be a maximum. During playback this bias frequency is eliminated by a notch ﬁlter so that the original sound is not distorted by the high- frequency signal. FIG. 23.90 Noise reduction in a tape recorder. Recording level 0 20 kHz 30 kHz Bias frequency High frequency drop off f During playback (P), the upper circuit of Fig. 23.89 is set to ground by the upper switch, and the lower network comes into play. Again note the second 100-pF capacitor connected to the base of the transistor to short to ground any undesirable high-frequency noise. The resistor is there to absorb any power associated with the noise signal when the capacitor takes on its short-circuit equivalence. Keep in mind that the capacitor was chosen to act as a short-circuit equivalent for a particular frequency range and not for the audio range where it is essentially an open circuit. APPLICATIONS  1079 Alternators in a car are notorious for developing high-frequency noise down the line to the radio, as shown in Fig. 23.91(a). This prob- lem is usually alleviated by placing a high-frequency ﬁlter in the line as shown. The inductor of 1 H will offer a high impedance for the range of noise frequencies, while the capacitor (1000 mF to 47,000 mF) will act as a short-circuit equivalent to any noise that happens to get through. For the speaker system in Fig. 23.91(b), the push-pull power arrangement of transistors in the output section can often develop a short period of time between pulses where the strong signal voltage is zero volts. During this short period the coil of the speaker rears its inductive effects, sees an unexpected path to ground like a switch open- ing, and quickly cuts off the speaker current. Through the familiar rela- tionship vL \u0001 L(diL /dt), an unexpected voltage will develop across the coil and set a high-frequency oscillation on the line that will ﬁnd its way back to the ampliﬁer and cause further distortion. This effect can be subdued by placing an R-C path to ground that will offer a low-resistance path from the speaker to ground for a range of frequencies typically generated by this signal distortion. Since the capacitor will assume a short-circuit equivalence for the range of noise disturbance, the resistor was added to limit the current and absorb the energy associated with the signal noise. dB FIG. 23.91 Noise generation: (a) due to a car alternator; (b) from a push-pull ampliﬁer.

The regulator, performing its primary function, will sense this drop in input voltage and will increase its ampliﬁcation level through a feedback loop to maintain a constant output. However, the spike is of such short duration that the output voltage will have a spike of its own because the input voltage has quickly returned to its normal level, and with the increased ampliﬁcation the output will jump to a higher level. Then the regulator senses its error and quickly cuts its gain. The sensitivity to changes in the input level has caused the output level to go through a number of quick oscillations that can be a real 1080  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS problem for the equipment to which the dc voltage is applied: A high- frequency noise signal has been developed. One way to subdue this reaction and, in fact, slow the system response down so that very short interval spikes have less impact is to add a capacitor across the output as shown in Fig. 23.92(b). Since the regulator is providing a ﬁxed dc level, a large capacitor of 1 mF can be used to short-circuit a wide range of high-frequency disturbances. However, you don’t want to make the capacitor too large or you’ll get too much damping, and large over- shoots and undershoots can develop. To maximize the input of the added capacitor, you must place it physically closer to the regulator to ensure that noise is not picked up between the regulator and capacitor and to avoid developing any delay time between output signal and capacitive reaction. In general, as you examine the schematic of working systems and see elements that don’t appear to be part of any standard design proce- dure, you can assume that they are either protective devices or due to noise on the line that is affecting the operation of the system. Noting their type, value, and location will often reveal their purpose and modus operandi. 23.17 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice High-Pass Filter The computer analysis will begin with an investi- gation of the high-pass ﬁlter of Fig. 23.93. The cutoff frequency is determined by fc \u0001 1/2pRC \u0001 1.592 kHz, with the voltage across the resistor approaching 1 V at high frequencies at a phase angle of 0°. For this analysis, the ac voltage source VAC was used. Within the Property Editor, the quantities deﬁned appear next to the source in Fig. 23.93. Otherwise, building the circuit is quite straightforward. Our interest lies in the effect of frequency on the magnitude of the output voltage across the resistor and the resulting phase angle. Follow- ing the selection of AC Sweep under the Analysis type heading, the Start Frequency should be set at 10 Hz so that we have some data points at the very low end and an End Frequency of 100 kHz so that we extend well into the high frequencies.

When V(R:1) is selected, the resulting SCHEMATIC1 appears as shown in Fig. 23.94. Note the nice transition from one region to the other. At low frequencies when the reactance of the capacitor far out- weighs that of the resistor, most of the applied voltage appears across the capacitor, and very little across the resistor. At much higher fre- quencies the reactance of the capacitor drops off very quickly, and the voltage across the resistor picks up toward a maximum of 1 V. Select Plot-Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace-P(V(R:1))- OK, and the phase plot of Fig.23.94 results showing a shift from 90°, when the network is highly capacitive in nature, to 0°, when it becomes resistive. If we select the phase plot SEL>> and click on the Toggle cursor pad, a left click will place a cursor on the screen that can deﬁne the frequency at which the phase angle is 45°. At 45.12°, which is the closest we can come with the available data points, we ﬁnd that the cor- responding frequency is 1.585 kHz which is a very close match with the 1.592 kHz calculated above. The right-click cursor can be placed at 100 kHz to show that the phase angle has dropped to 0.91°, which cer- tainly deﬁnes the network as resistive at this frequency. Double-Tuned Filter Our analysis will now turn to a fairly complex- looking ﬁlter for which an enormous amount of time would be required to generate a detailed plot of gain versus frequency using a handheld calculator. It is the same ﬁlter examined in Example 23.9, so we have a chance to test our theoretical solution.

Note the need for the two resistors in series with the inductors since inductors cannot be considered ideal elements. The small value of the resistive elements, however, will have no effect on the results obtained. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, AC Sweep wasagain selected with a Start Frequency of 100 Hz and an End Frequency of 10 MHz (be sure to enter this value as 10MEGHZ) to ensure that the full-range effect is provided. We can then use the axis controls to close in on the desired plot. The Points/Decade remains at 10k, although with this range of frequencies it may take a few seconds to simulate. Once the SCHEMATIC1 appears, Trace-Add Trace-V(RL:1)-OK will result in the plot of Fig. 23.96. Quite obviously there is a reject-band around 200 kHz and a pass-band around 600 kHz. Isn’t it interesting that up to 10 kHz we have another pass-band as the inductor Lp provides an almost direct path of low impedance from input to output. At frequen- cies approaching 10 MHz, there is a continous stop-band due to the open-circuit equivalence of the Lp inductor. Using the cursor option, we can place the left-click cursor on the minimum point of the graph by using the Cursor Trough key pad (the second pad to the right of the Toggle cursor pad). The right click can be used to identify the fre- quency of the maximum point on the curve near 600 kHz. The results appearing in the Probe Cursor box clearly support our theoretical cal- culations of 200 kHz for the band-stop minimum (A1 \u0001 200.02 kHz with a magnitude of essentially 0 V) and 600 kHz for the pass-band maximum (A2 \u0001 603.115 kHz with a magnitude of 1 V). dB FIG. 23.96 Magnitude plot versus frequency for the voltage across RL of the network of Fig. 23.95. 1084  DECIBELS, FILTERS, AND BODE PLOTS Let us now concentrate on the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz where most of the ﬁltering action is taking place. That was the advantage of choosing such a wide range of frequencies when the Simulation Set- tings were set up. The data have been established for the broad range of frequencies, and you can simply select a band of interest once the region of most activity is deﬁned. If the frequency range were too nar- row in the original simulation, another simulation would have to be deﬁned. Select Plot-Axis Settings-X Axis-User Deﬁned-10kHz to 1MEGHz-OK to obtain the plot at the bottom of Fig. 23.97. A dB plot of the results can also be displayed in the same ﬁgure by selecting Plot- Add Plot to Window-Trace-Add Trace-DB(V(RL:1))-OK, resulting in the plot at the top of the ﬁgure. Using our left-click cursor option and the Cursor Trough key, we ﬁnd that the minimum is at \u000383.48 dB at a frequency of 200 kHz, which is an excellent characteristic for a band- stop ﬁlter. Using the right-click cursor and setting it on 600 kHz, we ﬁnd that the drop is \u000330.11 \u0001dB or essentially 0 dB, which is excellent for the pass-band region. dB FIG. 23.97 dB and magnitude plot for the voltage across RL of the network of Fig. 23.95.

This chapter will introduce the basic ter- minology associated with the pulse waveform and will examine the response of an R-C circuit to a square-wave input. The importance of the pulse waveform to the electrical/electronics industry cannot be over- stated. A vast array of instrumentation, communication systems, com- puters, radar systems, and so on, all employ pulse signals to control operation, transmit data, and display information in a variety of for- mats. The response of the networks described thus far to a pulse signal is quite different from that obtained for sinusoidal signals. In fact, we will be returning to the dc chapter on capacitors (Chapter 10) to retrieve a few fundamental concepts and equations that will help us in the analy- sis to follow. The content of this chapter is quite introductory in nature, designed simply to provide the fundamentals that will be helpful when the pulse waveform is encountered in speciﬁc areas of application. 24.2 IDEAL VERSUS ACTUAL The ideal pulse of Fig. 24.1 has vertical sides, sharp corners, and a ﬂat peak characteristic; it starts instantaneously at t1 and ends just as abruptly at t2. The waveform of Fig. 24.1 will be applied in the analysis to follow in this chapter and will probably appear in the initial investigation of areas of application beyond the scope of this text. Once the fundamen- tal operation of a device, package, or system is clearly understood using ideal characteristics, the effect of an actual (or true or practical) pulse must be considered. If an attempt were made to introduce all the differ- ences between an ideal and actual pulse in a single ﬁgure, the result would probably be complex and confusing. A number of waveforms will therefore be used to deﬁne the critical parameters. Pulse Waveforms and the R-C Response 1094  PULSE WAVEFORMS AND THE R-C RESPONSE The reactive elements of a network, in their effort to prevent instan- taneous changes in voltage (capacitor) and current (inductor), establish a slope to both edges of the pulse waveform, as shown in Fig. 24.2. The rising edge of the waveform of Fig. 24.2 is deﬁned as the edge that increases from a lower to a higher level. Amplitude tp (pulse width) t1 t2 Falling or trailing edge Rising or leading edge v 0 t Ideal pulse FIG. 24.1 Ideal pulse waveform. Falling or trailing edge Rising or leading edge v 0 ttp (pulse width) Amplitude0.5V1 V1 FIG. 24.2 Actual pulse waveform. The falling edge is deﬁned by the region or edge where the waveform decreases from a higher to a lower level. Since the rising edge is the ﬁrst to be encountered (closest to t \u0001 0 s), it is also called the leading edge. The falling edge always follows the leading edge and is therefore often called the trailing edge. Both regions are deﬁned in Figs. 24.1 and 24.2. Amplitude For most applications, the amplitude of a pulse waveform is deﬁned as the peak-to-peak value. Of course, if the waveforms all start and return to the zero-volt level, then the peak and peak-to-peak values are synonymous. For the purposes of this text, the amplitude of a pulse waveform is the peak-to-peak value, as illustrated in Figs. 24.1 and 24.2. IDEAL VERSUS ACTUAL  1095 Pulse Width The pulse width (tp), or pulse duration, is deﬁned by a pulse level equal to 50% of the peak value. For the ideal pulse of Fig. 24.1, the pulse width is the same at any level, whereas tp for the waveform of Fig. 24.2 is a very speciﬁc value. Base-Line Voltage The base-line voltage (Vb) is the voltage level from which the pulse is initiated. The waveforms of Figs. 24.1 and 24.2 both have a 0-V base-line volt- age. In Fig. 24.3(a) the base-line voltage is 1 V, whereas in Fig. 24.3(b) the base-line voltage is \u00014 V. Amplitude = 4 V v 0 t Vb = 1 V 5 V (a) Amplitude = – 6 V v 0 t Vb = – 4 V (b) –10 V FIG. 24.3 Deﬁning the base-line voltage. Positive-Going and Negative-Going Pulses A positive-going pulse increases positively from the base-line voltage, whereas a negative-going pulse increases in the negative direction from the base-line voltage. The waveform of Fig. 24.3(a) is a positive-going pulse, whereas the waveform of Fig. 24.3(b) is a negative-going pulse. Even though the base-line voltage of Fig. 24.4 is negative, the wave- form is positive-going (with an amplitude of 10 V) since the voltage increased in the positive direction from the base-line voltage. FIG. 24.4 Positive-going pulse. tp v 0 t Amplitude = 10 V – 1 V 9 V Vb 1096  PULSE WAVEFORMS AND THE R-C RESPONSE Rise Time (tr ) and Fall Time (tf ) Of particular importance is the time required for the pulse to shift from one level to another. The rounding (deﬁned in Fig. 24.5) that occurs at the beginning and end of each transition makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne the exact point at which the rise time should be initiated and terminated. For this reason, the rise time and the fall time are deﬁned by the 10% and 90% levels, as indicated in Fig. 24.5. Note that there is no requirement that tr equal tf. v 0 ttr (90%) 0.9V1 V1 (10%) 0.1V1 tf FIG. 24.5 Deﬁning tr and tf . Tilt An undesirable but common distortion normally occurring due to a poor low-frequency response characteristic of the system through which a pulse has passed appears in Fig. 24.6. The drop in peak value is called tilt, droop, or sag. The percentage tilt is deﬁned by (24.1) where V is the average value of the peak amplitude as determined by (24.2) Naturally, the less the percentage tilt or sag, the more ideal the pulse. Due to rounding, it may be difﬁcult to deﬁne the values of V1 and V2. It is then necessary only to approximate the sloping region by a straight- line approximation and use the resulting values of V1 and V2. Other distortions include the preshoot and overshoot appearing in Fig. 24.7, normally due to pronounced high-frequency effects of a sys- tem, and ringing, due to the interaction between the capacitive and inductive elements of a network at their natural or resonant frequency.

The period (T) of the pulse train is deﬁned as the time differential between any two similar points on the pulse train, as shown in Figs. 24.11(a) and (b). The pulse repetition frequency (prf), or pulse repetition rate (prr), is deﬁned by (Hz or pulses/s) (24.3) Applying Eq. (24.3) to each waveform of Fig. 24.11 will result in the same pulse repetition frequency since the periods are the same. The result clearly reveals that the shape of the periodic pulse does not affect the determination of the pulse repetition frequency. prf (or prr) \u0002 \u0003 T 1 \u0003 0 v t FIG. 24.10 Pulse train. The pulse repetition frequency is determined solely by the period of the repeating pulse. The factor that will reveal how much of the period is encompassed by the pulse is called the duty cycle, deﬁned as fol- lows: Duty cycle \u0002\u0005 100% or (24.4) For Fig. 24.11(a) (a square-wave pattern), Duty cycle \u0002\u0005 100% \u0002 50% and for Fig. 24.11(b), Duty cycle \u0002\u0005 100% \u0002 20% The above results clearly reveal that the duty cycle provides a percentage indication of the portion of the total period encompassed by the pulse waveform. 0.2T\u0003 T 0.5T\u0003 T Duty cycle \u0002 \u0003 t T p \u0003\u0005 100% pulse width\u0003\u0003 period 0 v t tp T T (a) 2 T T (1 ms) 2T (2 ms) 3T (3 ms) 0 v t tp T T (b) 2 T T (1 ms) 2T (2 ms) 3T (3 ms) 0.2T FIG. 24.11 Periodic pulse trains.

The ﬁrst is the procedure outlined in Section 13.6, which can be applied to any alternating waveform. The second can be applied only to pulse waveforms since it utilizes terms speciﬁcally related to pulse waveforms; that is, (24.5) In Eq. (24.5), the peak value is the maximum deviation from the ref- erence or zero-volt level, and the duty cycle is in decimal form. Equa- tion (24.5) does not include the effect of any tilt pulse waveforms with sloping sides. EXAMPLE 24.6 Determine the average value for the periodic pulse waveform of Fig. 24.15.

The resulting equation for the voltage across a capacitor is repeated below for conve- nience. (24.6) Recall that Vi is the initial voltage across the capacitor when the transient phase is initiated as shown in Fig. 24.18. The voltage Vf is the steady-state (resting) value of the voltage across the capacitor when the transient phase has ended. The transient period is approximated as 5t, where t is the time constant of the network and is equal to the product RC. For the situation where the initial voltage is zero volts, the equation reduces to the following familiar form, where Vf is often the applied voltage: Vi \u0002 0 V (24.7) For the case of Fig. 24.19, Vi \u0002\u00012 V, Vf \u0002\u00045 V, and vC \u0002 Vi \u0004 (Vf \u0001 Vi)(1 \u0001 e \u0001t/RC) \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 [5 V \u0001 (\u00012 V)](1 \u0001 e \u0001t/RC) vC \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 7 V(1 \u0001 e \u0001t/RC) For the case where t \u0002 t \u0002 RC, vC \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 7 V(1 \u0001 e \u0001t/t) \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 7 V(1 \u0001 e \u00011) \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 7 V(1 \u0001 0.368) \u0002\u00012 V \u0004 7 V(0.632) vC \u0002 2.424 V as veriﬁed by Fig. 24.19.

The resulting waveforms for vC and iC will appear as shown in Fig. 24.27. Note how closely the voltage vC shadows the applied waveform and how iC is nothing more than a series of very sharp spikes. Note also that the change of Vi from V to zero volts during the trailing edge simply results in a rapid discharge of vC to zero volts. In essence, when Vi \u0002 0, the capacitor and resistor are in parallel and the capacitor simply dis- charges through R with a time constant equal to that encountered dur- ing the charging phase but with a direction of charge ﬂow (current) opposite to that established during the charging phase.

The voltage vC no longer resembles the square-wave input and, in fact, has some of the charac- teristics of a triangular waveform. The increased time constant has resulted in a more rounded vC, and iC has increased substantially in width to reveal the longer charging period. R-C circuit as shown in Fig. 24.26, the period of the square wave can have a pronounced effect on the resulting waveform for vC. For the analysis to follow, we will assume that steady-state condi- tions will be established after a period of ﬁve time constants has passed. The types of waveforms developed across the capacitor can then be separated into three fundamental types: T/2 \u0007 5t; T/2 \u0002 5t; and T/2 \b 5t. 1106  PULSE WAVEFORMS AND THE R-C RESPONSE T/2 < 5t If T/2 < 5t or T < 10t, the voltage vC will not reach its ﬁnal value dur- ing the ﬁrst pulse (Fig. 24.29), and the discharge cycle will not return to zero volts. In fact, the initial value for each succeeding pulse will change until steady-state conditions are reached. In most instances, it is a good approximation to assume that steady-state conditions have been established in ﬁve cycles of the applied waveform. vC 0 tT T 2T 2 V 5t 5t T 2 = 5t (a) iC 0 tT T 2T 2 5t (b) 5t V R V R – FIG. 24.28 vC and iC for T/2 \u0002 5t. As the frequency increases and the period decreases, there will be a ﬂattening of the response for vC until a pattern like that in Fig. 24.30 results. Figure 24.30 begins to reveal an important conclusion regarding the response curve for vC: Under steady-state conditions, the average value of vC will equal the average value of the applied square wave. vC 0 tT T 2T 2 V 5t T 2 < 5t (a) 3T iC 0 tT T 2T 2 (b) 5t V R V R – 3T FIG. 24.29 vC and iC for T/2 < 5t.

The voltage vC will not reach the ﬁnal value before the ﬁrst pulse of the square-wave input returns to zero volts.

In other words, for each interval of Fig. 24.34, the beginning of the transient waveform is deﬁned as t \u0002 0 s. The value of vC at t \u0002 T is therefore determined by substituting t \u0002 t into the above equation, and not 2t as deﬁned by Fig. 24.34.

Continuing in the same manner, the remaining waveform for vC will be generated as depicted in Fig. 24.34. Note that repetition occurs after t \u0002 8t, and the waveform has essentially reached steady-state condi- tions in a period of time less than 10t, or ﬁve cycles of the applied square wave. A closer look will reveal that both the peak and the lower levels con- tinued to increase until steady-state conditions were established. Since the exponential waveforms between t \u0002 4T and t \u0002 5T have the same time constant, the average value of vC can be determined from the steady-state 7.31-mV and 2.69-mV levels as follows: Vav \u0002\u0002 \u0002 5 mV which equals the average value of the applied signal as stated earlier in this section.

Note in Fig. 24.35 that the positive peak current decreased toward steady-state conditions while the negative peak became more negative. It is also interesting and important to realize that the current waveform becomes symmetrical about the axis when steady-state conditions are established. The result is that the net average current over one cycle is zero, as it should be in a series R-C circuit.

If the input impedance to a scope is 1 M\u0006, the \u000510 attenuator probe will have an internal resistance of 9 M\u0006, as shown in Fig. 24.36. 0 V 200 V – + Rs 1 M\u0002 Vertical Scope 20 V0 V Rp 9 M\u0002 Probe FIG. 24.36 \u000510 attenuator probe.

The probe capacitance is typically about 10 pF for a 1-m (3.3-ft) cable, reaching about 15 pF for a 3-m (9.9-ft) cable. The total input capaci- tance is therefore the sum of the two capacitive elements, resulting in the equivalent network of Fig. 24.38. 1 \u0003 10 (1 M\u0006)(Vi)\u0003\u0003 1 M\u0006\u0004 9 M\u0006 Rs = 1 M\u000220 pFCs Vscope Scope Cable 10 pF (1 meter cable) Cc Vi 9 M\u0002 Rp Probe FIG. 24.37 Capacitive elements present in an attenuator probe arrangement.

To improve matters, a variable capacitor is often added in parallel with the resistance of the attenuator, resulting in a compensated atten- uator probe such as the one shown in Fig. 24.41. In Chapter 21, it was demonstrated that a square wave can be generated by a summation of sinusoidal signals of particular frequency and amplitude. If we there- fore design a network such as the one shown in Fig. 24.42 that will ensure that Vscope is 0.1vi for any frequency, then the rounding distortion will be removed, and Vscope will have the same appearance as vi. Applying the voltage divider rule to the network of Fig. 24.42, (24.8) If the parameters are chosen or adjusted such that (24.9) the phase angle of Zs and Zp will be the same, and Equation (24.8) will reduce to (24.10) which is insensitive to frequency since the capacitive elements have dropped out of the relationship. In the laboratory, simply adjust the probe capacitance using a stan- dard or known square-wave signal until the desired sharp corners of the square wave are obtained. If you avoid the calibration step, you may make a rounded signal look square since you assumed a square wave at the point of measurement. Too much capacitance will result in an overshoot effect, whereas too little will continue to show the rounding effect. 24.8 APPLICATION TV Remote The TV remote, or “clicker,” is so much a part of our modern-day living that we must all have wondered at one time or another how it looks inside or how it works.

The only major difference between the TV remote and the other controls is that the TV remote uses an infrared frequency while the other two use a much lower radio frequency. The TV remote of Fig. 24.43(a) has been opened to reveal the inter- nal construction of its key pad and face in Fig. 24.43(b). The three com- ponents of Fig. 24.43(b) were placed at a level that would permit match- ing the holes in the cover with the actual keys in the switch membrane and with the location that each button on the key pad would hit on face of the printed circuit board. Note on the printed circuit board that there FIG. 24.43 TV remote: (a) external appearance; (b) internal construction; (c) carbon key pads; (d) enlarged view of S31 key pad. 1114  PULSE WAVEFORMS AND THE R-C RESPONSE is a black pad to match each key on the membrane. The back side of the switch membrane is shown in Fig. 24.43(c) to show the soft carbon con- tacts that will make contact with the carbon contacts on the printed board when the buttons are depressed. An enlarged view of one of the contacts (S31) of Fig. 24.43(c) is shown in Fig. 24.43(d) to illustrate the separation between circuits and the pattern used to ensure continuity when the solid round carbon pad at the bottom of the key is put in place. All the connections established when a key is pressed are passed on to a relatively large switch-matrix-encoder IC chip appearing on the back side of the printed circuit board as shown in Fig. 24.44. For the pad (S31) of Fig. 24.43(d), three wires of the matrix appearing in Fig. 24.43(b) will be connected when the corresponding key (number 5) is pressed. The encoder will then react to this combination and send out the appropriate signal as an infrared (IR) signal from the IR LED appearing at the end of the remote control, as shown in Fig. 24.43(b) and Fig. 24.44. The second smaller LED (red on actual unit) appearing at the top of Fig. 24.43(b) blinks during transmission. Once the batter- ies are inserted, the CMOS electronic circuitry that controls the opera- tion of the remote is always on. This is possible only because of the very low power drain of CMOS circuitry. The power (PWR) button is used only to turn the TV on and activate the receiver. The signal sent out by the majority of remotes is one of the two types appearing in Fig. 24.45. In each case there is a key pulse to initiate the signal sequence and to inform the receiver that the coded signal is about to arrive. In Fig. 24.45(a), a 4-bit binary-coded signal is transmitted using pulses in speciﬁc locations to represent the “ones” and using the absence of a pulse to represent the “zeros.” That coded signal can then be interpreted by the receiver unit and the proper operation performed. In Fig. 24.45(b), the signal is frequency controlled. Each key will have a different frequency associated with it. The result is that each key will have a speciﬁc transmission frequency. Since each TV receiver will respond to a different pulse train, a remote must be coded for the TV under control. There are ﬁxed program remotes that can be used with FIG. 24.45 Signal transmission: (a) pulse train; (b) variation.

Then there are smart remotes that are preprogrammed internally with a number of remote control codes. Remotes of this type simply need to be told which TV is involved using a three-digit coding system, and they will adapt accordingly. Learning remotes are those that can use the old remote to learn the code and then store it for future use. In this case, one remote is set directly in front of the other, and the information is transferred from one to the other when both are ener- gized. Remotes are also available that are a combination of the last two. The remote of Fig. 24.43 uses four AAA batteries in series for a total of 6 V. It has its own local crystal oscillator separate from the IC as shown by the discrete elements to the top right and midleft of the printed circuit board of Fig. 24.43(c). The crystal itself, which is rela- tively large compared to the other elements, appears on the other side of the board just above the electrolytic capacitor in Fig. 24.44. It is the responsibility of the oscillator to generate the pulse signal required for proper IC operation. Note how ﬂush most of the discrete elements are in Fig. 24.43(b), and note the rather large electrolytic capacitor on the back of the printed circuit board in Fig. 24.44. The speciﬁcations on the unit give it a range control of 25 ft with a 30° coverage arc as shown in Fig. 24.46. The arc coverage of your unit can easily be tested by simply pointing it directly at the TV and then moving it in any direction until it no longer controls the TV. 24.9 COMPUTER ANALYSIS PSpice R-C Response Our analysis will begin with a veriﬁcation of the results of Example 24.10 which examined the response of the series R- C circuit appearing on the schematic of Fig. 24.47. The source is one used in Chapters 10 and 12 to replicate the action of a switch in series with a dc source. The deﬁning attributes for the pulse waveform are repeated for convenience in Fig. 24.48. Recall that the PW was made long enough so that the full transient period could be examined. In this analysis the pulse width will be adjusted to permit viewing the transient behavior of an R-C network between changing levels of the applied pulse. Initially the PW will be set at 10 times the time constant of the network so that the full transient response can occur between changes in voltage level. The time constant of the network is t \u0001 RC \u0001 (5 k\u0001)(0.01 mF) \u0001 0.05 ms, resulting in a PW of 0.5 ms in Fig. 24.47. To establish a square-wave appearance, the period was chosen as twice the pulse width or 1 ms as shown in the VPulse listing. In the Simulation Settings dialog box, Time Domain(Transient) is selected because we want a response versus time. The Run to time is selected as 2 ms so that two full cycles will result. The Start saving data after was left on the default value of 0 s, and the Maximum step size was set at 2 ms/1000 \u0001 2 ms.

Now we can left- click on V(C:1) at the bottom right of the graph and set a cursor on the graph with a left click of the mouse. Setting the cursor at ﬁve time con- stants reveals that the transient voltage has reached 9.935 mV. Setting the right-click cursor at ten time constants reveals that VC has essen- tially reached the 10-mV level. Setting tp \u0002 t \u0002 T/2 The parameters of the source will now be modiﬁed by changing the frequency of the pulse waveform to 10 kHz with a period of 0.1 ms and a pulse width of 0.05 ms. For Vpulse the changes are PW \u0001 0.05 ms and PER \u0001 0.1 ms. The time constant of the network remains the same at 0.05 ms, so we have a situation where the pulse width equals the time constant of the circuit. The result is that it will take a number of pulses before the voltage across the capacitor will reach its ﬁnal value of 10 mV. Under the Simulation Settings, the Run to time will be changed to 0.5 ms \u0001 500 msorﬁve cycles of the applied voltage. The Maximum step size will be changed to 500 ms/1000 \u0001 500 ns \u0001 0.5 ms. Under the SCHEMATIC1 window, Trace-Add Trace-V(C:1)-OK is selected to obtain the transient volt- age across the capacitor, while Trace-Add Trace-V(Vpulse:\u0001))-OK will place the applied voltage on the same screen. Note in the resulting plots of Fig. 24.50 that the voltage builds up from 0 V until it appears to reach a fairly steady state after 400 ms. At 400 ms, a left cursor (A1) was used to ﬁnd the minimum point with 2.71 mV resulting—a close match with the longhand calculation of Example 24.11 at 2.69 mV. At 450 ms, the right-click cursor (A2) provided a level of 7.29 mV which is again a close match with the calculated level of 7.31 mV. FIG. 24.48 Deﬁning the PSpice Vpulse parameters.

The most obvious and famil- iar are the dc, square-wave, triangular, sawtooth, and rectiﬁed wave- forms of Fig. 25.1. NON t v (a) t v (b) t v (c) t v (d) t v (e) FIG. 25.1 Common nonsinusoidal waveforms: (a) dc; (b) square-wave; (c) triangular; (d) sawtooth; (e) rectiﬁed. The output of many electrical and electronic devices will be non- sinusoidal, even though the applied signal may be purely sinusoidal. For example, the network of Fig. 25.2 employs a diode to clip off the negative portion of the applied signal in a process called half-wave rec- tiﬁcation, which is used in the development of dc levels from a sinu- soidal input. You will ﬁnd in your electronics courses that the diode is similar to a mechanical switch, but it is different because it can conduct current in only one direction. The output waveform is deﬁnitely non- sinusoidal, but note that it has the same period as the applied signal and matches the input for half the period. Nonsinusoidal Circuits This chapter will demonstrate how a nonsinusoidal waveform like the output of Fig. 25.2 can be represented by a series of terms. You will also learn how to determine the response of a network to such an input. 25.2 FOURIER SERIES Fourier series refers to a series of terms, developed in 1826 by Baron Jean Fourier (Fig. 25.3), that can be used to represent a nonsinusoidal periodic waveform. In the analysis of these waveforms, we solve for each term in the Fourier series: (25.1) Depending on the waveform, a large number of these terms may be required to approximate the waveform closely for the purpose of circuit analysis. As shown in Eq. (25.1), the Fourier series has three basic parts. The ﬁrst is the dc term A0, which is the average value of the waveform over one full cycle. The second is a series of sine terms. There are no restric- tions on the values or relative values of the amplitudes of these sine terms, but each will have a frequency that is an integer multiple of the frequency of the ﬁrst sine term of the series. The third part is a series of cosine terms. There are again no restrictions on the values or relative values of the amplitudes of these cosine terms, but each will have a fre- quency that is an integer multiple of the frequency of the ﬁrst cosine term of the series. For a particular waveform, it is quite possible that all of the sine or cosine terms are zero. Characteristics of this type can be determined by simply examining the nonsinusoidal waveform and its position on the horizontal axis. The ﬁrst term of the sine and cosine series is called the fundamen- tal component. It represents the minimum frequency term required to represent a particular waveform, and it also has the same frequency as the waveform being represented. A fundamental term, therefore, must be present in any Fourier series representation. The other terms with higher-order frequencies (integer multiples of the fundamental) are called the harmonic terms. A term that has a frequency equal to twice the fundamental is the second harmonic; three times, the third har- monic; and so on. 1124  NONSINUSOIDAL CIRCUITS NON FIG. 25.2 Half-wave rectiﬁer producing a nonsinusoidal waveform. 0 R e T 2 T t 0 vo T 2 T t ++ –– vo Ideal diode e f (t) \u0001 A0 \u0002 A1 sin \u0003t \u0002 A2 sin 2\u0003t \u0002 A3 sin 3\u0003t \u0002 . . . \u0002 An sin n\u0003t dc or average value sine terms \u0002 B1 cos \u0003t \u0002 B2 cos 2\u0003t \u0002 B3 cos 3\u0003t \u0002 . . . \u0002 Bn cos n\u0003t cosine terms French (Auxerre, Grenoble, Paris) (1768–1830) Mathematician, Egyptologist, and Administrator Professor of Mathematics, École Polytechnique Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution Photo No. 56,822 Best known for an inﬁnite mathematical series of sine and cosine terms called the Fourier series which he used to show how the conduction of heat in solids can be analyzed and deﬁned. Although he was primarily a mathematician, a great deal of Fourier’s work revolved around real-world physical occurrences such as heat transfer, sunspots, and the weather. He joined the École Polytechnique in Paris as a faculty member when the institute ﬁrst opened. Napoleon requested his aid in the research of Egyptian antiquities, resulting in a three-year stay in Egypt as Secretary of the Institut d’Égypte. Napoleon made him a baron in 1809, and he was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1817. FIG. 25.3 Baron Jean Fourier. FOURIER SERIES  1125 Average Value: A0 The dc term of the Fourier series is the average value of the waveform over one full cycle. If the net area above the horizontal axis equals that below in one full period, A0 \u0001 0, and the dc term does not appear in the expansion. If the area above the axis is greater than that below over one full cycle, A0 is positive and will appear in the Fourier series represen- tation. If the area below the axis is greater, A0 is negative and will appear with the negative sign in the expansion. Odd Function (Point Symmetry) If a waveform is such that its value for \u0001t is the negative of that for \u0002t, it is called an odd function or is said to have point symmetry. Figure 25.4(a) is an example of a waveform with point symmetry. Note that the waveform has a peak value at t1 that matches the magni- tude (with the opposite sign) of the peak value at \u0004t1. For waveforms of this type, all the parameters B1→∞ of Eq. (25.1) will be zero. In fact, waveforms with point symmetry can be fully described by just the dc and sine terms of the Fourier series. Note in Fig. 25.4(b) that a sine wave is an odd function with point sym- metry.

For both waveforms of Fig. 25.4, the following mathematical rela- tionship is true: (odd function) (25.2) In words, it states that the magnitude of the function at \u0002t is equal to the negative of the magnitude at \u0004t [t1 in Fig. 25.4(a)]. f(t) \u0001\u0004f(\u0004t) 1126  NONSINUSOIDAL CIRCUITS NON f(t) Even function Average value (A0) t1–t1 0 t Symmetry about vertical axisNonsinusoidal waveform (a) f(t) Cosine wave Average = 0 (A0 = 0) t Symmetry about vertical axis 0 (b) FIG. 25.5 Axis symmetry. Mirror or Half-Wave Symmetry If a waveform has half-wave or mirror symmetry as demonstrated by the waveform of Fig. 25.6, the even harmonics of the series of sine and cosine terms will be zero. In functional form the waveform must satisfy the following relation- ship: f(t) –TT 2 – T 2 T 3 2T t0 t1 T 2 t1 + FIG. 25.6 Mirror symmetry. Even Function (Axis Symmetry) If a waveform is symmetric about the vertical axis, it is called an even function or is said to have axis symmetry. Figure 25.5(a) is an example of such a waveform. Note that the value of the function at t1 is equal to the value at \u0004t1. For waveforms of this type, all the parameters A1→∞ will be zero. In fact, waveforms with axis symmetry can be fully described by just the dc and cosine terms of the Fourier series. Note in Fig. 25.5(b) that a cosine wave is an even function with axis symmetry. For both waveforms of Fig. 25.5, the following mathematical rela- tionship is true: (even function) (25.3) In words, it states that the magnitude of the function is the same at \u0002t1 as at \u0004t [t1 in Fig. 25.5(a)]. f(t) \u0001 f(\u0004t) FOURIER SERIES  1127 f(t) \u0001\u0004f\u0001t \u0002 \u0005 T 2 \u0005\u0002 (25.4) Equation (25.4) states that the waveform encompassed in one time interval T/2 will repeat itself in the next T/2 time interval, but in the negative sense (t1 in Fig. 25.6). For example, the waveform of Fig. 25.6 from zero to T/2 will repeat itself in the time interval T/2 to T, but below the horizontal axis. Repetitive on the Half-Cycle The repetitive nature of a waveform can determine whether speciﬁc har- monics will be present in the Fourier series expansion. In particular, if a waveform is repetitive on the half-cycle as demonstrated by the waveform of Fig. 25.7, the odd harmonics of the series of sine and cosine terms are zero. NON t f(t) t1 t1 + T 2 TT 2 FIG. 25.7 A waveform repetitive on the half-cycle. In functional form the waveform must satisfy the following relation- ship: f(t) \u0001 f\u0001t \u0002 \u0005 T 2 \u0005\u0002 (25.5) Equation (25.5) states that the function repeats itself after each T/2 time interval (t1 in Fig. 25.7). The waveform, however, will also repeat itself after each period T. In general, therefore, for a function of this type, if the period T of the waveform is chosen to be twice that of the minimum period (T/2), the odd harmonics will all be zero. Mathematical Approach The constants A0, A1→n, B1→n can be determined by using the following integral formulas: A0 \u0001 \u0005 T 1 \u0005\u0003 T 0 f(t) dt (25.6) An \u0001 \u0005 T 2 \u0005\u0003 T 0 f(t) sin nqt dt (25.7) 1128  NONSINUSOIDAL CIRCUITS Bn \u0001 \u0005 T 2 \u0005\u0003 T 0 f(t) cos nqt dt (25.8) These equations have been presented for recognition purposes only; they will not be used in the following analysis. Instrumentation There are three types of instrumentation available that will reveal the dc, fundamental, and harmonic content of a waveform: the spectrum analyzer, wave analyzer, and Fourier analyzer. The purpose of such instrumentation is not solely to determine the composition of a particu- lar waveform but also to reveal the level of distortion that may have been introduced by a system. For instance, an ampliﬁer may be increas- ing the applied signal by a factor of 50, but in the process it may have distorted the waveform in a way that is quite unnoticeable from the oscilloscope display. The amount of distortion would appear in the form of harmonics at frequencies that are multiples of the applied frequency. Each of the above instruments would reveal which frequencies are hav- ing the most impact on the distortion, permitting their removal with properly designed ﬁlters. The spectrum analyzer has the appearance of an oscilloscope, as shown in Fig. 25.8, but rather than display a waveform that is voltage (vertical axis) versus time (horizontal axis), it generates a display scaled off in dB (vertical axis) versus frequency (horizontal axis). Such a dis- play is said to be in the frequency domain versus the time domain of the standard oscilloscope. The height of the vertical line in the display of Fig. 25.8 reveals the impact of that frequency on the shape of the wave- form. Spectrum analyzers are unable to provide the phase angle associ- ated with each component. The wave analyzer of Fig. 25.9 is a true rms voltmeter whose fre- quency of measurement can be changed manually. In other words, the operator works through the frequencies of interest, and the analog dis- play will indicate the rms value of each harmonic component present. Of course, once the fundamental component is determined, the operator can quickly move through the possible harmonic levels. The wave ana- lyzer, like the spectrum analyzer, is unable to provide the angle associ- ated with the various components. The Fourier analyzer of Fig. 25.10 is similar in many respects to the spectrum analyzer except for its ability to investigate all the fre- quencies of interest at one time. The spectrum analyzer must review the signal one frequency at a time. The Fourier analyzer has the dis- tinct advantage of being able to determine the phase angle of each component. The following examples will demonstrate the use of the equations and concepts introduced thus far in this chapter. NON FIG. 25.8 Spectrum analyzer.

FOURIER SERIES  1131 As an additional example in the use of the Fourier series approach, consider the square wave shown in Fig. 25.15. The average value is zero, so A0 \u0001 0. It is an odd function, so all the constants B1→n equal zero; only sine terms will be present in the series expansion. Since the waveform satisﬁes the criteria for f(t) \u0001\u0004f(t \u0002 T/2), the even har- monics will also be zero.

If we add the fundamental and third harmonics, we obtain the results shown in Fig. 25.16. Even with only the ﬁrst two terms, a few characteristics of the square wave are beginning to appear. If we add the next two terms (Fig. 25.17), the width of the pulse increases, and the number of peaks increases. 1132  NONSINUSOIDAL CIRCUITS As we continue to add terms, the series will better approximate the square wave. Note, however, that the amplitude of each succeeding term diminishes to the point at which it will be negligible compared with those of the ﬁrst few terms. A good approximation would be to assume that the waveform is composed of the harmonics up to and including the ninth. Any higher harmonics would be less than one-tenth the fundamental. If the waveform just described were shifted above or below the horizontal axis, the Fourier series would be altered only by a change in the dc term. Figure 25.18(c), for example, is the sum of Fig. 25.18(a) and (b). The Fourier series for the complete waveform is, therefore, v \u0001 v1 \u0002 v2 \u0001 Vm \u0002 Eq.

Recall that this theorem allowed us to consider the effects of each source of a circuit independently. If we replace the nonsinusoidal input with the terms of the Fourier series deemed necessary for practical considera- tions, we can use superposition to ﬁnd the response of the network to each term (Fig. 25.21).

The total response of the system is then the algebraic sum of the val- ues obtained for each term. The major change between using this theo- rem for nonsinusoidal circuits and using it for the circuits previously described is that the frequency will be different for each term in the nonsinusoidal application. Therefore, the reactances XL \u0001 2pfL and XC \u0001 will change for each term of the input voltage or current.

(25.12) to state that Vrms \u0001 4V \u0002 0.707 (6 V) \u0001 8.242 V, which is incorrect and, in fact, exceeds the correct level by some 41%. Instrumentation It is important to realize that not every DMM will read the rms value of nonsinusoidal waveforms such as the one appearing in Fig. 25.23. Many are designed to read the rms value of sinusoidal waveforms only. It is important to read the manual provided with the meter to see if it is a true rms meter that can read the rms value of any waveform. We learned in Chapter 13 that the rms value of a square wave is the peak value of the waveform. Let us test this result using the Fourier expansion and Eq. (25.11). EXAMPLE 25.6 Determine the rms value of the square wave of Fig. 25.15 with Vm \u0001 20 V using the ﬁrst six terms of the Fourier expansion, and compare the result to the actual rms value of 20 V.

Click OK, and the wider line of Fig. 25.29 will result, making it a great deal clearer where the 0-V line is located. Through the same process the curve was made yellow and wider as shown in the same ﬁgure. Using the cursors, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst peak will reach 11.84 V and then drop to 8.920 V.

Although the content of this chapter will be a surface treatment at best, the material will introduce a number of important terms and techniques employed in the system analysis approach. The increasing use of packaged systems is quite understandable when we consider the advantages associated with such structures: reduced size, sophisticated and tested design, reduced construction time, reduced cost compared to discrete designs, and so forth. The use of any packaged system is limited solely to the proper utilization of the provided terminals of the system. Entry into the inter- nal structure is not permitted, which also eliminates the possibility of repair to such systems. System analysis includes the development of two-, three-, or multi- port models of devices, systems, or structures. The emphasis in this chapter will be on the conﬁguration most frequently subject to model- ing techniques: the two-port system of Fig. 26.1.

For some devices, the two-port network of Fig. 26.1 may appear as shown in Fig. 26.2(a). The block diagram of Fig. 26.2(a) simply indicates that terminals 1′ and 2′ are in common, which is a particular case of the general two-port network. A single- port network and a multiport network appear in Fig. 26.2(b). The for- mer has been analyzed throughout the text, while the characteristics of the latter will be touched on in this chapter, with a more extensive cov- erage left for a more advanced course. The latter part of this chapter introduces a set of equations (and, subsequently, networks) that will allow us to model the device or sys- tem appearing within the enclosed structure of Fig. 26.1. That is, we will be able to establish a network that will display the same terminal characteristics as those of the original system, device, and so on. In Fig. 26.3, for example, a transistor appears between the four external terminals. Through the analysis to follow, we will ﬁnd a combination of network elements that will allow us to replace the transistor with a network that will behave very much like the original device for a spe- ciﬁc set of operating conditions. Methods such as mesh and nodal analysis can then be applied to determine any unknown quantities. The models, when reduced to their simplest forms as determined by the operating conditions, can also provide very quick estimates of network behavior without a lengthy mathematical derivation. In other words, someone well-versed in the use of models can analyze the operation of large, complex systems in short order. The results may be only approximate in most cases, but this quick return for a minimum of effort is often worthwhile. The analysis of this chapter is limited to linear (ﬁxed-value) systems with bilateral elements. Three sets of parameters are developed for the two-port conﬁguration, referred to as the impedance (z), admittance (y), and hybrid (h) parameters. Table 26.1 at the end of the chapter relates the three sets of parameters. 26.2 THE IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS Zi AND Zo For the two-port system of Fig. 26.4, Zi is the input impedance between terminals 1 and 1′, and Zo is the output impedance between terminals 2 and 2′. For multiport networks an impedance level can be deﬁned between any two (adjacent or not) terminals of the network. The input impedance is deﬁned by Ohm’s law in the following form: FIG. 26.2 (a) Two-port system; (b) single-port system and multiport system.

This is common practice for a number of system analysis methods to avoid concern about the actual direction for each current and also to deﬁne Zi and Zo as positive quantities in Eqs. (26.1) and (26.2), respectively. If Io were chosen to be leaving the system, Zo as deﬁned in Eq. (26.2) would have to have a negative sign. An experimental setup for determining Zi for any two input termi- nals is provided in Fig. 26.5. The sensing resistor Rs is chosen small enough not to disturb the basic operation of the system or to require too large a voltage Eg to establish the desired level of Ei. Under operating conditions, the voltage across Rs is Eg \u0003 Ei, and the current through the sensing resistor is IRs \u0002\u0002 But Ii \u0002 IRs and Zi \u0002\u0002 Ei\u0004 IRs Ei\u0004 Ii Eg \u0003 Ei\u0004 Rs VRs\u0004 Rs Zo \u0002 \u0004 E Io o \u0004 Zi \u0002 \u0004 E Ii i \u0004 FIG. 26.5 Determining Zi. Ei IRs Rs VRs Ii + – + – Eg Zi Two-port system The sole purpose of the sensing resistor, therefore, was to determine Ii using purely voltage measurements. As we progress through this chapter, keep in mind that we cannot use an ohmmeter to measure Zi or Zo since we are dealing with ac sys- tems whose impedance may be sensitive to the applied frequency. Ohm- meters can be used to measure resistance in a dc or an ac network, but recall that ohmmeters are employed only on a de-energized network, and their internal source is a dc battery. The output impedance Zo can be determined experimentally using the setup of Fig. 26.6. Note that a sensing resistor is introduced again, with Eg being an applied voltage to establish typical operating conditions. In addition, note that the input signal must be set to zero, as deﬁned by Eq. 1152  SYSTEM ANALYSIS: AN INTRODUCTION (26.2).

Forthe majority of situations, Zi and Zo will be purely resistive, result- ing in an angle of zero degrees for each impedance. The result is that either a DMM or a scope can be used to ﬁnd the required magnitude of the desired quantity. For instance, for both Zi and Zo, VRs can be measured directly with the DMM, as can the required levels of Eg, Ei,or Eo. The cur- rent for each case can then be determined using Ohm’s law, and the imped- ance level can be determined using either Eq. (26.1) or Eq. (26.2). If we use an oscilloscope, we must be more sensitive to the common ground requirement. For instance, in Fig. 26.4, Eg and Ei can be mea- sured with the oscilloscope since they have a common ground. Trying to measure VRs directly with the ground of the oscilloscope at the top input terminal of Ei would result in a shorting effect across the input terminals of the system due to the common ground between the supply and oscilloscope. If the input impedance of the system is “shorted out,” the current Ii can rise to dangerous levels because the only resistance in the input circuit is the relatively small sensing resistor Rs. If we use the DMM to avoid concern about the grounding situation, we must be sure that the meter is designed to operate properly at the frequency of inter- est. Many commercial units are limited to a few kilohertz. If the input impedance has an angle other than zero degrees (purely resistive), a DMM cannot be used to ﬁnd the reactive component at the input terminals. The magnitude of the total impedance will be correct if measured as described above, but the angle from which the resistive and reactive components can be determined will not be provided. If an oscilloscope is used, the network must be hooked up as shown in Fig. 26.7. Both the voltage Eg and VRs can be displayed on the oscilloscope at the same time, and the phase angle between Eg and VRs can be deter- mined. Since VRs and Ii are in phase, the angle determined will also be the angle between Eg and Ii. The angle we are looking for is between Ei and Ii, not between Eg and Ii, but since Rs is usually chosen small enough, we can assume that the voltage drop across Rs is so small com- pared to Eg that Ei \u0001 Eg. Substituting the peak, peak-to-peak, or rms values from the oscilloscope measurements, along with the angle just determined, will permit a determination of the magnitude and angle for THE IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS Zi AND Zo  1153 Zi, from which the resistive and reactive components can be determined using a few basic geometric relationships. The reactive nature (induc- tive or capacitive) of the input impedance can be determined when the angle between Ei and Ii is computed. For a dual-trace oscilloscope, if Eg leads VRs (Ei leads Ii), the network is inductive; if the reverse is true, the network is capacitive. To determine the angle associated with Zo, the sensing resistor must again be moved to the bottom to form a common ground with the sup- ply Eg. Then, using the approximation Eg \u0001 Eo, the magnitude and angle of Zo can be determined.

The subscript NL reveals that the ratio was determined under no-load conditions; that is, a load was not applied to the output terminals when the gain was determined. The no-load voltage gain is the gain typically provided with packaged systems since the applied load is a function of the application. The magnitude of the ratio can be determined using a DMM or an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope, however, must be used to determine the phase shift between the two voltages. In Fig. 26.12 a load has been introduced to establish a loaded gain that will be denoted simply as Av and deﬁned by (26.4)Av \u0002 \u0004 E E o i \u0004 with RL AvNL \u0002 \u0004 E E o i \u0004 FIG. 26.11 Deﬁning the no-load gain AvNL. + – + – EoEi AvNL Ei Rg + – + – Eg Av Eo + – RL VL = Eo + – FIG. 26.12 Deﬁning the loaded voltage gain Av (and AvT). For all two-port systems the loaded gain Av will always be less than the no-load gain. In other words, the application of a load will always reduce the gain below the no-load level. A third voltage gain can be deﬁned using Fig. 26.12 since it has an applied voltage source with an associated internal resistance—a situa- tion often encountered in electronic systems. The total voltage gain of the system is represented by AvT and is deﬁned by (26.5) It is the voltage gain from the source Eg to the output terminals Eo. Due to loss of signal voltage across the source resistance, the voltage gain AvT is always less than the loaded voltage gain Av or unloaded gain AvNL. AvT \u0002 \u0004 E E o g \u0004 1156  SYSTEM ANALYSIS: AN INTRODUCTION If we expand Eq. (26.5) as follows: AvT \u0002\u0002 (1) \u0002 \u0002\u0003 \u0002 ⋅ then AvT \u0002 Av (if loaded) or AvT \u0002 AvNL (if unloaded) The relationship between Ei and Eg can be determined from Fig. 26.12 if we recognize that Ei is across the input impedance Zi and thus apply the voltage divider rule as follows: Ei \u0002 or \u0002 Substituting into the above relationships will result in (if loaded) (26.6) (if unloaded) (26.7) A two-port equivalent model for an unloaded system based on the deﬁnitions of Zi, Zo, and AvNL is provided in Fig. 26.13. Both Zi and Zo appear as resistive values since this is typically the case for most elec- tronic ampliﬁers. However, both Zi and Zo can have reactive compo- nents and not invalidate the equivalency of the model.

The input impedance is deﬁned by Zi \u0002 Ei /Ii and the voltage Eo \u0002 AvNLEi in the absence of a load, resulting in AvNL \u0002 Eo/Ei as deﬁned. The output impedance is deﬁned with Ei set to zero volts, resulting in AvNLEi \u0002 0 V, which permits the use of a short-circuit equivalent for the controlled source. The result is Zo \u0002 Eo/Io, as deﬁned, and the parame- ters and structure of the equivalent model are validated. If a load is applied as in Fig. 26.14, an application of the voltage divider rule will result in Eo Ro + – RL + – AvNLEi FIG. 26.14 Applying a load to the output of Fig. 26.13. THE VOLTAGE GAINS AvNL, Av, AND AvT  1157 Eo \u0002 and (26.8) For any value of RL or Ro, the ratio RL /(RL \u0005 Ro) must be less than 1, mandating that Av is always less than AvNL as stated earlier. Further, for a ﬁxed output impedance (Ro), the larger the load resistance (RL ), the closer the loaded gain to the no-load level. An experimental procedure for determining Ro can be developed if we solve Eq. (26.8) for the output impedance Ro: Av \u0002 AvNL or Av(RL \u0005 Ro) \u0002 RLAvNL AvRL \u0005 AvRo \u0002 RLAvNL and AvRo \u0002 RLAvNL \u0003 AvRL with Ro \u0002 or (26.9) Equation (26.9) reveals that the output impedance Ro of an ampliﬁer can be determined by ﬁrst measuring the voltage gain Eo/Ei without a load in place to ﬁnd AvNL and then measuring the gain with a load RL to ﬁnd Av. Substitution of AvNL, Av, and RL into Eq. (26.9) will then pro- vide the value for Ro.

For current levels, Equation (26.12) reveals that the larger the level of RL, the less the current gain of a loaded ampliﬁer. In the design of an ampliﬁer, therefore, one must balance the desired voltage gain with the current gain and the resulting ac output power level. For the system of Fig. 26.17, the power delivered to the load is determined by E 2 o/RL, whereas the power delivered at the input termi- nals is E 2 i /Ri. The power gain is therefore deﬁned by AG \u0002\u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\u0003 2 and (26.13) Expanding the conclusion, AG \u0002 (Av)\u0002Av \u0003 \u0002 (Av)(\u0003Ai) so (26.14) Don’t be concerned about the minus sign. Av or Ai will be negative to ensure that the power gain is positive, as obtained from Eq. (26.13). If we substitute Av \u0002\u0003AiRL/Ri [from Eq. (26.10)] into Eq.

Too often the labeled no-load gains are employed, resulting in enor- mous overall gains and unreasonably high expectations for the system. In addition, bear in mind that the input impedance of stage 3 may affect the input impedance of stage 2 and, therefore, the load on stage 1. In general, therefore, the equations for cascaded systems initially appear to offer a high level of simplicity to the analysis. Simply be aware, however, that each term of the overall equations must be care- fully evaluated before using the equation. The total voltage gain for the system of Fig. 26.19 is (26.18) where, as noted above, the ampliﬁcation factor of each stage is deter- mined under loaded conditions. The total current gain for the system of Fig. 26.19 is (26.19) where, again, the gain of each stage is determined under loaded (con- nected) conditions. The current gain between any two stages can also be determined using an equation developed earlier in the chapter. For cascaded sys- tems, the equation has the following general format: (26.20) where Av is the loaded voltage gain corresponding to the desired loaded current gain. That is, if the gain is from the ﬁrst to the third stages, then Ai \u0002 Av\u0004 R Z L i \u0004 AiT \u0002 Ai1 ⋅ Ai2 ⋅ Ai3 AvT \u0002 Av1 ⋅ Av2 ⋅ Av3 CASCADED SYSTEMS  1163 the voltage gain substituted is also from the ﬁrst to third stages. The input impedance Zi is for the ﬁrst stage of interest, and RL is the load- ing on the last stage of interest.

For most situations, if any two are speciﬁed, the remaining two variables can be determined. The four variables can be related by the following equations: (26.22a) (26.22b) The impedance parameters z11, z12, and z22 are measured in ohms. To model the system, each impedance parameter must be determined by setting a particular variable to zero. z11 For z11, if I2 is set to zero, as shown in Fig. 26.23, Equation (26.22a) becomes E1 \u0002 z11I1 \u0005 z12(0) and I2 \u0002 0 (ohms, \u0001) (26.23) Equation (26.23) reveals that with I2 set to zero, the impedance param- eter is determined by the resulting ratio of E1 to I1. Since E1 and I1 are both input quantities, with I2 set to zero, the parameter z11 is formally referred to in the following manner: z11 \u0005 open-circuit, input-impedance parameter z12 For z12, I1 is set to zero, and Equation (26.22a) results in I2 \u0002 0 (ohms, \u0001) (26.24) For most systems where input and output quantities are to be com- pared, the ratio of interest is usually that of the output quantity divided by the input quantity. In this case, the reverse is true, resulting in the following: z12 \u0005 open-circuit, reverse-transfer impedance parameter The term transfer is included to indicate that z12 will relate an input and output quantity (for the condition I1 \u0002 0). The network conﬁgura- tion for determining z12 is shown in Fig. 26.24. z12 \u0002 \u0004 E I2 1 \u0004 z11 \u0002 \u0004 E I1 1 \u0004 E2 \u0002 z21I1 \u0005 z22I2 E1 \u0002 z11I1 \u0005 z12I2 FIG. 26.22 Two-port impedance parameter conﬁguration.

(26.22b). That is, I2 \u0002 0 (ohms, \u0001) (26.25) In this case, input and output quantities are again the determining variables, requiring the term transfer in the nomenclature. However, the ratio is that of an output to an input quantity, so the descriptive term forward is applied, and z21 \u0002 open-circuit, forward-transfer impedance parameter The determining network is shown in Fig. 26.25. For an applied voltage E1, it is determined by the ratio E2/I1 with I2 set to zero. z22 The remaining parameter, z22, is determined by I1 \u0002 0 (ohms, \u0001) (26.26) as derived from Eq. (26.22b) with I1 set to zero. Since it is the ratio of the output voltage to the output current with I1 set to zero, it has the ter- minology z22 \u0002 open-circuit, output-impedance parameter The required network is shown in Fig. 26.26. For an applied voltage E2, it is determined by the resulting ratio E2/I2 with I1 \u0002 0. EXAMPLE 26.7 Determine the impedance (z) parameters for the T network of Fig. 26.27.

Hybrid Equivalent Network—Output Impedance For the out- put impedance, the applied source VSIN is set to 0 V by replacing it with a direct 0-\u0001 connection. Then a 1-A current source is applied as shown in Fig. 26.57. The ISRC current source was selected because it 1184  SYSTEM ANALYSIS: AN INTRODUCTION has the arrow in the symbol. Everything else in the network remains the same, so there is no need to rebuild the entire network. Simply make the changes and run the simulation. Even the simulation does not have to be changed since the chosen parameters will remain the same. The current source was given a magnitude of 1 A so that the magnitude of the VPRINT1 voltage would also be the magnitude of the output impedance. The results of Fig. 26.58 indicate an output impedance of 200 k\u0001. The following theoretical analysis reveals that the output impedance is indeed 200 k\u0001: Zo \u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 200 k\u0002 1\u0004\u0004 5 \u0006 10 \u00026 S 1\u0004\u0004\u0004 25 \u0006 10 \u00026 S \u0002 20 \u0006 10 \u00026 S 1———— 25 \u0006 10 \u00026 S \u0002 \u0004 (4 \u0006 1 k 1 \u0005 0 \u0002 \u0003 4)( 0 50)\u0004 1—— ho \u0002 \u0004 hi h \u0003 rhf Rs \u0004 FIG. 26.58 Output ﬁle for the voltage across the 1-A current source (and output impedance) of the network of Fig. 26.57.

Once the procedure is properly understood, solutions can be obtained with a minimum of time and effort and usually with fewer errors than when using other methods. Consider the following equations, where x and y are the unknown variables and a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2 are constants: (C.1a) (C.1b) It is certainly possible to solve for one variable in Eq. (C.1a) and substitute into Eq. (C.1b). That is, solving for x in Eq. (C.1a), x \u0003 and substituting the result in Eq. (C.1b), a2 \u0001\u0002 \u0004 b2y \u0003 c2 It is now possible to solve for y, since it is the only variable remain- ing, and then substitute into either equation for x. This is acceptable for two equations, but it becomes a very tedious and lengthy process for three or more simultaneous equations. Using determinants to solve for x and y requires that the following formats be established for each variable: c1 \u0002 b1y\u0005 a1 c1 \u0002 b1y\u0005 a1 Col. 1 Col. 2 Col. 3 a1x \u0004 b1y \u0003 c1 a2x \u0004 b2y \u0003 c2 Col. Col. Col. Col. 12 1 2 \u0003c1 b1 \u0003\u0003a1 c1 \u0003 \u0003c2 b2 \u0003\u0003a2 c2 \u0003 x \u0003 –––––––– y \u0003 ––––––– (C.2) \u0003a1 b1 \u0003\u0003a1 b1 \u0003 \u0003a2 b2 \u0003\u0003a2 b2 \u0003 First note that only constants appear within the vertical brackets and that the denominator of each is the same. In fact, the denominator is simply the coefﬁcients of x and y in the same arrangement as in Eqs. (C.1a) and (C.1b). When solving for x, replace the coefﬁcients of x in the numerator by the constants to the right of the equal sign in Eqs. (C.1a) and (C.1b), and simply repeat the coefﬁcients of the y variable. When solving for y, replace the y coefﬁcients in the numerator by the constants to the right of the equal sign, and repeat the coefﬁcients of x. Each conﬁguration in the numerator and denominator of Eqs. (C.2) is referred to as a determinant (D), which can be evaluated numerically in the following manner: APPENDIX C  1199 (C.3) The expanded value is obtained by ﬁrst multiplying the top left ele- ment by the bottom right and then subtracting the product of the lower left and upper right elements. This particular determinant is referred to as a second-order determinant, since it contains two rows and two columns. It is important to remember when using determinants that the columns of the equations, as indicated in Eqs. (C.1a) and (C.1b), must be placed in the same order within the determinant conﬁguration. That is, since a1 and a2 are in column 1 of Eqs. (C.1a) and (C.1b), they must be in column 1 of the determinant. (The same is true for b1 and b2.) Expanding the entire expression for x and y, we have the following: (C.4a) (C.4b) EXAMPLE C.1 Evaluate the following determinants: \u000322\u0003 a. \u0003 (2)(4) \u0002 (3)(2) \u0003 8 \u0002 6 \u0003 2\u000334\u0003 \u00034 \u00021\u0003 b. \u0003 (4)(2) \u0002 (6)(\u00021) \u0003 8 \u0004 6 \u0003 14\u00036 \u00022\u0003 \u0003 0 \u00022\u0003 c. \u0003 (0)(4) \u0002 (\u00022)(\u00022) \u0003 0 \u0002 4 \u0003 \u00014\u0003\u00022 \u00024\u0003 \u00030 10\u0003 d. \u0003 (0)(10) \u0002 (3)(0) \u0003 0\u0003310\u0003 EXAMPLE C.2 Solve for x and y: 2x \u0004 y \u0003 3 3x \u0004 4y \u0003 2 Solution: \u000331\u0003 x \u0003\u0003 \u0003 \u0003 \u0003 2 \u000334\u0003 10 \u0005 5 12 \u0002 2\u0005 8 \u00023 (3)(4) \u0002 (2)(1)\u0005\u0005 (2)(4) \u0002 (3)(1) \u000324\u0003\u0005 \u000321\u0003 \u0003a1 c1 \u0003 \u0003a2 c2 \u0003 a1c2 \u0002 a2c1y \u0003 –––––––– \u0003 –––––––––– \u0003a1 b1 \u0003 a1b2 \u0002 a2b1 \u0003a2 b2 \u0003 \u0003c1 b1 \u0003 \u0003c2 b2 \u0003 c1b2 \u0002 c2b1x \u0003 –––––––– \u0003 –––––––––– \u0003a1 b1 \u0003 a1b2 \u0002 a2b1 \u0003a2 b2 \u0003 Col.

First we will examine a shorthand method that is applicable to third-order determinants only, since most of the prob- lems in the text are limited to this level of difﬁculty. We will then inves- tigate the general procedure for solving any number of simultaneous equations. Consider the three following simultaneous equations: Col. 1 Col. 2 Col. 3 Col. 4 a1x \u0004 b1y \u0004 c1z \u0003 d1 a2x \u0004 b2y \u0004 c2z \u0003 d2 a3x \u0004 b3y \u0004 c3z \u0003 d3 in which x, y, and z are the variables, and a1,2,3, b1,2,3, c1,2,3, and d1,2,3 are constants. The determinant conﬁguration for x, y, and z can be found in a man- ner similar to that for two simultaneous equations. That is, to solve for x, ﬁnd the determinant in the numerator by replacing column 1 with the elements to the right of the equal sign. The denominator is the determi- nant of the coefﬁcients of the variables (the same applies to y and z). Again, the denominator is the same for each variable. d1 b1 c1a1 d1 c1a1 b1 d1 d2 b2 c2 a2 d2 c2a2 b2 d2 x \u0003 , y \u0003 , z \u0003 a1 b1 c1 where D \u0003 a2 b2 c2 a3 b3 c3 A shorthand method for evaluating the third-order determinant con- sists simply of repeating the ﬁrst two columns of the determinant to the right of the determinant and then summing the products along speciﬁc diagonals as shown below: The products of the diagonals 1, 2, and 3 are positive and have the following magnitudes: \u0004a1b2c3 \u0004 b1c2a3 \u0004 c1a2b3 The products of the diagonals 4, 5, and 6 are negative and have the following magnitudes: \u0002a3b2c1 \u0002 b3c2a1 \u0002 c3a2b1 The total solution is the sum of the diagonals 1, 2, and 3 minus the sum of the diagonals 4, 5, and 6: (C.5)\u0004(a1b2c3 \u0004 b1c2a3 \u0004 c1a2b3) \u0002 (a3b2c1 \u0004 b3c2a1 \u0004 c3a2b1) D \u0003 a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3 4(\u0002)5(\u0002)6(\u0002) 1(\u0004)2(\u0004)3(\u0004) a3 b3 d3\u0005\u0005 D a3 d3 c3\u0005\u0005 D d3 b3 c3 \u0005\u0005 D 1202  APPENDIXES Warning: This method of expansion is good only for third-order determinants!

There is more than one expansion that will generate the correct result, but this form is typically employed when the material is ﬁrst intro- duced. This expansion was obtained by multiplying the elements of the ﬁrst row of D by their corresponding cofactors. It is not a requirement that the ﬁrst row be used as the multiplying factors. In fact, any row or column (not diagonals) may be used to expand a third-order deter- minant. The sign of each cofactor is dictated by the position of the mul- tiplying factors (a1, b1, and c1 in this case) as in the following stan- dard format: 18 \u0005 13 18 \u0005 13 \u00023\u0005 13 18 \u0005 13 15 \u0005 13 26 \u0005 13 \u00021\u0005 13 27 \u0005 13 13 \u0005 13 2 \u0005 13 15 \u0005 13 1- 13 27 \u0005 13 26 \u0005 13 9 \u0005 13 1204  APPENDIXES Note that the proper sign for each element can be obtained by simply assigning the upper left element a positive sign and then changing sign as you move horizontally or vertically to the neighboring position. For the determinant D, the elements would have the following signs: a1(\u0004) b1(\u0002) c1(\u0004) a2(\u0002) b2(\u0004) c2(\u0002) a3(\u0004) b3(\u0002) c3(\u0004) The minors associated with each multiplying factor are obtained by covering up the row and column in which the multiplying factor is located and writing a second-order determinant to include the remain- ing elements in the same relative positions that they have in the third- order determinant. Consider the cofactors associated with a1 and b1 in the expansion of D. The sign is positive for a1 and negative for b1 as determined by the standard format. Following the procedure outlined above, we can ﬁnd the minors of a1 and b1 as follows: It was pointed out that any row or column may be used to expand the third-order determinant, and the same result will still be obtained. Using the ﬁrst column of D, we obtain the expansion The proper choice of row or column can often effectively reduce the amount of work required to expand the third-order determinant. For example, in the following determinants, the ﬁrst column and third row, respectively, would reduce the number of cofactors in the expansion: EXAMPLE C.7 Expand the following third-order determinants: 123 21 2323 a.
